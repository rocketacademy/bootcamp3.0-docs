# 0.4: JS Object as Tally

## Introduction

JS Objects are useful for tallying frequencies of elements in arrays. For example, for a hand of cards, we could use an Object to tally the frequency of each card name. We can use card names as Object keys, and frequencies as Object values. The algorithm to tally card name frequencies works as follows.

1. Initialise an empty JS Object `tally`.
2. Iterate through the hand array.
3. For each card in the hand array, do the following.
   1. If that card's name exists in `tally`, increment its value by 1.
   2. Else, add that card's name as a key in `tally` with value 1.

This algorithm can be used to tally other card attributes by using those attributes as key names, for example ranks and suits.

## Sample Code

See [1.5: High Card](../1-frontend-basics/1.3-high-card-dom.md#basic-high-card) DOM for implementations of `makeDeck` and `shuffleCards` functions.

### Create Tally

```javascript
// Create shuffled deck
var deck = shuffleCards(makeDeck());

// Create hand array of 5 cards
var hand = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
  hand.push(deck.pop());
}

// Create Object as tally
var cardNameTally = {};

// Loop over hand
for (let i = 0; i < hand.length; i += 1) {
  var cardName = hand[i].name;
  // If we have seen the card name before, increment its count
  if (cardName in cardNameTally) {
    cardNameTally[cardName] += 1;
  }
  // Else, initialise count of this card name to 1
  else {
    cardNameTally[cardName] = 1;
  }
}
```

### Read Tally

When we wish to analyse the results in the tally, we can loop over the keys and values in the tally as follows. The following code prints out the frequency of each card name.

```javascript
for (cardName in cardNameTally) {
  console.log(`There are ${cardNameTally[cardName]} ${cardName}s in the hand`);
}
```
