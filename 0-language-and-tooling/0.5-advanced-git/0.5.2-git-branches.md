# 0.5.2: Git Branches

## Introduction

Git repos can consist of several parallel series of commits called **branches**. This is helpful when there are multiple engineers working on the same repo and each is working on their own feature, which may require 1 or more independent commits. Engineers develop features on their own "feature branches" so that they do not interfere with development of other engineers.

So far in Basics and Bootcamp we have only worked on the `main` branch, but in teams we almost never want to code on `main`, because `main` is reserved for tested and approved code running in production. Once a developer completes their new feature in their feature branch, they can **merge** their branch back to `main` to "release" the feature to their teammates and users.

## Why Use Branches

### Team Work

Dev teams use branches to work on a project simultaneously without affecting each other. Engineers on teams create a new branch for each new feature, which can be as small as a typo bug fix, or as big as a new product. Once a branch has been merged to `main`, it can be deleted.

### Solo Work

Some engineers use branches even when coding solo for a few reasons.

1. To keep track of different sets of changes simultaneously.
2. To try things out without copying files, e.g. keeping a "safe" version in `main`.
3. To designate code for different features of a project.

## Using Branches

### Create a Branch

Create a new branch named "my-feature". `git checkout` allows us to switch or "checkout" branches, and the `-b` flag creates a new branch and checks it out.

```
git checkout -b my-feature
```

Verify we are on the new `my-feature` branch with `git branch`.

```
git branch
```

Once on a branch we can make commits that build on the state of `main` when we created the branch. New commits on our branch will be independent from new commits on any other branch.

### Change Branch

We should commit changes before switching branches to avoid polluting other branches. Run `git checkout` without the `-b` flag to checkout an existing branch.

```
git checkout main
```

### Branch Naming

We name branches with `kebab-case` by convention if there is more than one word.

## Git Merge

### Basic Usage

![Git Merge attempts to merge commits from 1 branch to another.](../../.gitbook/assets/akira-shared-a-drawing-with-you.png)

When we are done with our feature, we may wish to **merge** our work back to `main` so others can admire our work. Here is how we can do this.

1. Checkout the branch we want to merge into. E.g. if we want to merge our changes to `main`, we should checkout `main`.
2.  Run `git merge` followed by the source branch, e.g. `my-feature`.

    ```
    git merge my-feature
    ```
3. Git will combine commits from both branches and create a "merge commit" to resolve any differences.

### Advanced Usage

We do not only merge feature branches to `main`. Often when developing a larger feature, we will want to merge `main` into our feature branch periodically to verify whether our changes still work with the latest code on `main`. This is to pre-empt situations where someone may have committed changes to `main` that are incompatible with the features on our branch.

![We can also use Git Merge to merge changes from main to our feature branch.](<../../.gitbook/assets/akira-shared-a-drawing-with-you-2 (1).png>)

## Merge Conflicts

### What are Merge Conflicts

Git is not always able to resolve differences between 2 branches automatically. If two branches change the same lines of the same files, there may be a "**merge conflict**". Merge conflicts are typically a result of miscommunication between team members, where both team members edit the same code in different ways at the same time.

### How to Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. Once we have a merge conflict, we must resolve the conflict before doing anything else with Git. Merge conflicts can be intimidating but can be easy to resolve.
2. Run `git status` to see which files have conflicts.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-29-at-9.55.58-pm.png)

1. Open the files in red from `git status` output. These have merge conflicts.
2. Git will have added the following lines to our code to indicate where the conflicts are.
   1.  HEAD represents the latest commit in your repo. The changes from HEAD start at the following line.

       ```
       <<<<<<< HEAD
       ```
   2.  The changes from HEAD end at the following series of equal signs, and the changes from the conflicting branch begin after the equal signs.

       ```
       =======
       ```
   3.  The set of conflicting changes from the `spelling` branch ends with the following.

       ```
       >>>>>>> spelling
       ```
   4. If you're not sure where to find the merge conflict, search for the repeated `<`, `=`, or `>` characters above. VSCode highlights merge conflicts in our files, providing convenient buttons to choose 1 change or another.
3. Once we've found each merge conflict, decide which changes to keep. Edit the file to the way it should be after this merge, removing all Git symbols and irrelevant code.

![Example merge conflict containing the above conflict symbols.](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-29-at-9.56.04-pm.png)

1. Once we've fixed merge conflicts in all files, we can `add` them to staging and `commit` them. This will trigger Git to create a merge commit with an auto-generated commit message.
2. Though we've "resolved" the merge conflict, Git does not check if our app still works. Remember to remove the Git symbols, or we may get a syntax error!
3. If we are unable to resolve the conflict because we are unsure which changes to keep, we can abort the merge for now with `git merge --abort`.

## Exercises

### Branch and Merge Without Conflicts

1.  Create a new repo.

    ```
    mkdir poems
    cd poems
    git init
    ```
2. Create a poem about water in `water-poem.txt`. Commit this file to the repo.
3.  Create and checkout a new branch to edit the water poem.

    ```
    git checkout -b water-poem-edits
    ```
4. Edit the water poem and commit it to the new branch you just created.
5.  List all branches.

    ```
    git branch
    ```
6.  Checkout `main`.

    ```
    git checkout main
    ```
7. Verify `water-poem.txt` has reverted to the version on `main`.
8. Create a new poem about sandwiches in a new file and commit it.
9.  Checkout the water poem branch.

    ```
    git checkout water-poem-edits
    ```
10. Verify the sandwich poem does not exist in the water poem branch.
11. Checkout `main` and merge the water poem edits from the water poem branch.
12. Verify `water-poem.txt` contains the changes from the water poem branch.

### Resolve Merge Conflicts

1.  Make a new branch for edits to the sandwich poem.

    ```
    git checkout -b sandwich-poem-edits
    ```
2. While on the sandwich branch, add a line to the poem and change the line that's currently there.
3. Commit the changes on the sandwich branch.
4. To create a merge conflict we will commit **new changes to the same lines** in the other branch.
5. Checkout `main`.
6. Make a change to the sandwich poem and commit it.
7. Merge the sandwich branch into `main`.
8. We should observe a merge conflict.
9. Open the sandwich poem file to see the merge conflict symbols from Git.
10. Resolve the merge conflict as per instructions above.
