# 0.5.1: Git Pull

## Introduction

So far we've learned to create, fork, clone, and push repo changes to GitHub.

Now that we have a 2nd copy of our repo on EC2, we need to keep code in sync between the 2. Specifically, after making changes locally and pushing them to GitHub, we may wish to sync those changes to EC2 without cloning the repo again. 

The solution is `git pull`. Pull retrieves all new changes from a remote repo.

## Exercise

While SSH'ed into the EC2 instance and in the relevant repo folder, run `git pull`. If it says there are no changes to pull, push new changes to your repo on GitHub and try `git pull` again.
