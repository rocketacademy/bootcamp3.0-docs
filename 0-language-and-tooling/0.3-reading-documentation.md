# 0.3: Reading Documentation

## Introduction

Due to the wide scope of material in Coding Bootcamp \(and coding in general\), googling will become more important to solve problems. We expect students to become more independent software engineers by using Google as a resource. Googling effectively may be the most important takeaway from RA's courses.

Reading documentation for a given language, framework, or library is crucial to coding. Even the best software engineers spend a significant amount of time googling. It takes practice and will feel awkward when starting. As you gain experience you will develop strategies for finding and absorbing different types of documentation to solve problems.

The goal when reading docs is to find relevant information as quickly as possible. Strong developers know how to skim docs efficiently without reading too much. This is analogous to finding information from an encyclopaedia or dictionary as efficiently as possible.

## Exercise

1. Read an intro to developer documentation [here](http://cassandrawilcox.me/beginners-guide-developer-documentation/).
2. Look up the documentation for the JavaScript [Date object.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) \(You can also google around for the answer\).
3. Create a new copy of the [starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code) Create a button that displays today's date when clicked.
