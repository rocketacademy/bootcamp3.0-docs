# 0.6: Nodemon

## Introduction

[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is an application that restarts our server every time we change a file that the server depends on. This is especially useful in development when we are making regular changes to our server code.

## Usage

1. Instead of running `node index.js`, which requires us to `Ctrl+C` and restart our server every time we make code changes, we can use Nodemon.
2. Install [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) globally to avoid stopping and starting our server every time our files change. This makes the command available globally on our system.

   ```text
   npm i -g nodemon
   ```

3. Running the following command to start our server will cause our server to restart each time we save a file it depends on. The `-e js` argument tells Nodemon to only restart on changes to JS files. By default Nodemon also "watches" \(i.e. restart on changes\) JSON files, which can be troublesome when we work with JSON files as DBs.

   ```text
   nodemon index.js -e js
   ```

4. Once we transition to SQL DBS, feel free to use `nodemon` without the `-e` argument.
