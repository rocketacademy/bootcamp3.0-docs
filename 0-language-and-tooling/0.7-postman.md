# 0.7: Thunder Client

1. [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/) is a VSCode Extension we can use to send requests and receive responses without a frontend.
2. It provides a convenient interface for creating and populating request URLs, methods, bodies, and query parameters.
3. After sending requests with TC, TC shows us formatted server responses in the VSCode interface.
