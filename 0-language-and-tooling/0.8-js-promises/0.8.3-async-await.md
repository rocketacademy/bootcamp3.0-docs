# 0.8.3: Async/Await

## Introduction

Async and await, commonly abbreviated as async/await, is an ES6 syntax built upon Promises that enables writing asynchronous JavaScript in a synchronous manner without callbacks. The `async` keyword specifies that a given function is asynchronous and returns a Promise, and the `await` keyword will wait on a given Promise to resolve before proceeding to the next line. `async` and `await` keywords must be used together; it is not meaningful to use `async` without `await`, and it is invalid syntax to use `await` without `async`.

## Normal Asynchronous Function Call: setTimeout

The following script does not use async and await keywords, or even Promises. It calls the function `doStuff`, which calls `setDelay`, which invokes an asynchronous timeout callback. Each of the console log statements runs in synchronous code order, with the exception of the `setTimeout` callback, which runs after the timeout duration.

### Script File

```javascript
const randomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

const setDelay = (delay) => {
  console.log(`delaying ${delay}`);
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('done with timeout');
  }, delay);
};

const doStuff = () => {
  console.log('setting timeout');
  setDelay(randomNumber());
  console.log('after call settimeout');
};

console.log('about to call do stuff');
doStuff();
console.log('finished call do stuff');
```

### Output

```text
about to call do stuff
setting timeout
delaying 852
after call settimeout
finished call do stuff
done with timeout
```

## Asynchronous Function Call with Promise and Async/Await

The following code is slightly different in that there is an `await` keyword on line 16, which causes the console log on line 17 to wait for `setDelay` to resolve before running. Meanwhile, because `doStuff` is an async function, `doStuff` will return with a Promise before `doStuff` runs to completion. Async/await gives us simpler syntax to control which parts of our code should run asynchronously and synchronously.

### Script File

```javascript
const randomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

const setDelay = (delay) => {
  console.log(`delaying ${delay}`);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('done with timeout');
      resolve(delay);
    }, delay);
  });
};

const doStuff = async () => {
  console.log('about to set timeout');
  await setDelay(randomNumber());
  console.log('after call setTimeout');
};

console.log('about to call do stuff');
doStuff();
console.log('finished call do stuff');
```

### Output

```text
about to call do stuff
about to set timeout
delaying 934
finished call do stuff
done with timeout
after call setTimeout
```

## Async/Await with `pg` Library

So far we have been using `.then` syntax with `pg` library methods. Let's see how we could convert our `.then`s to `await`s. In the following code, the return value of `await pool.query(...);` on line 4 is the resolved value of the Promise returned by `pool.query`. More info on using `pg` with async and await [here](https://node-postgres.com/guides/async-express).

### Async/Await Example

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', async (request, response) => {
  const { id } = request.params;
  console.log('making query');
  const { rows } = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]);
  console.log('done with query');
  response.send(rows);
});
```

### .then Example

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (request, response) => {
  const { id } = request.params;
  console.log('making query');
  pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]).then((result) => {
    const { rows } = result;
    console.log('done with query');
    response.send(rows);
  };
});
```

## Async/Await with Try/Catch

From this Promise `.catch` example, how do we keep the error handling of `.catch`, and still convert this code from Promises to async/await? We can go back to the original syntax of the `try` block.

### `.then`, `.catch` Syntax

```javascript
let category = 'vegan';

client
  .query('SELECT * from categories WHERE name= $1', [category])
  .then((result) => {
    let categoryId = result.rows[0].id;
    return client.query('SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE category_id = $1', [
      categoryId,
    ]);
  })
  .then((result) => {
    let recipes = result.rows;

    // ...
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // in Express.js we might respond 400 or 500.
    console.log(error);
  });
```

### Async/Await, Try/Catch Syntax

```javascript
const getData = async (category) => {
  try {
    const categories = await client.query(
      'SELECT * from categories WHERE name= $1',
      [category]
    );

    let categoryId = categories[0].id;
    const recipes = await client.query(
      'SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE category_id = $1',
      [categoryId]
    );

    // ...

    // catch errors thrown by client.query
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

getData('vegan');
```

## Async/Await Helps Control Where to Pause and Where to Continue

`await` syntax appears to cause our program to pause on a given line, e.g. line 13. However, note that the `async` function `doStuff` returns before it has completed, allowing lines 19-21 to run before `doStuff` on line 18 is complete.

### Script File

```javascript
const setDelay = (delay) => {
  console.log(`delaying ${delay}`);
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('done with timeout');
      resolve(delay);
    }, delay);
  });
};

const doStuff = async (delay) => {
  console.log(`about to set timeout with delay: ${delay}`);
  await setDelay(delay);
  console.log(`after call setTimeout with delay: ${delay}`);
};

console.log('about to call do stuff, wait a second');
doStuff(1000);
console.log('about to call do stuff 2nd time, wait .7 sec');
doStuff(700);
console.log('finished call do stuff');
```

### Output

```text
about to call do stuff, wait a second
about to set timeout with delay: 1000
delaying 1000
about to call do stuff 2nd time, wait .7 sec
about to set timeout with delay: 700
delaying 700
finished call do stuff
done with timeout
after call setTimeout with delay: 700
done with timeout
after call setTimeout with delay: 1000
```

## When to Use Async/Await and When to Use `.then`

`async`/`await` is a drop in replacement for Promise syntax everywhere. Remember though that it cannot replace Promises in all cases, and `async`/`await` syntax does not absolve you from knowing about Promises.

The two main exceptions to async/await usage are:

1\) Browser compatibility

Await is not supported in all browsers: [https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript\_operators\_await](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_await)

2\) Asynchronous callbacks do not always need to happen sequentially.

Awaiting a callback result heavily implies that you need the result for the next callback.

```javascript
const getData = async (category) => {
  try {
    const categories = await client.query(
      'SELECT * from categories WHERE name= $1',
      [category]
    );

    let categoryId = categories[0].id;
    const recipes = await client.query(
      'SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE category_id = $1',
      [categoryId]
    );

    // ...

    // catch errors thrown by client.query
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

getData('vegan');
```

If you are getting unrelated data the code is more time efficient in a Promise.

```javascript
const getData = async (category) => {

  const categories = client.query(
    'SELECT * from categories WHERE name= $1',
    [category]
  );

  const users = client.query(
    'SELECT * FROM users'
  );
  
  try{
    // we don't care about which query finishes first
    // but wait for both to be done before moving on
    const results = await Promise.all([categories,users])
    
    console.log(results);
  } catch (error){
    console.log(error);
  }
};

getData('vegan');
```
