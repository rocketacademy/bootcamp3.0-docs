# 0.8.1: Promise.prototype.catch, Promise.all

## Introduction

This module introduces more advanced usage of Promises via the `.catch` and `.all` methods.

## `.catch`

We had previously seen `.catch` in [Module 3.7: JavaScript Promises](./#creating-promises) but may not have used it in our apps. Let's discuss what `.catch` does more specifically and how to use it. We'll use Promises returned by `pg` library functions as examples but any Promise \(with or without external libraries\) will have the same `.catch` behaviour.

### Catch Errors from Chained Promises

On line 12 we throw an exception to exit this series of dependent queries because without a valid recipe we cannot proceed. The `.catch` block on line 19 catches this exception and handles it gracefully.

```javascript
let category = 'vegan';

client
  .query('SELECT * from categories WHERE name= $1', [category])
  .then((result) => {
    let categoryId = result.rows[0].id;
    return pool.query('SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE category_id = $1', [
      categoryId,
    ]);
  })
  .then((result) => {
    // check to see if we got results
    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
      throw 'no recipes';
    }

    let recipes = result.rows;

    // ...
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // in Express.js we might respond 400 or 500.
    console.log(error);
  });
```

### Catch Errors from Individual Promise

In the following example we see that a `throw` in a self-constructed Promise can also be caught by a `.catch` block on that Promise. On line 25 we declare the `catch` block that will handle the `throw` on line 11.

```javascript
// random number representing between 0 and .999 seconds
const randomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

// function that wraps setTimeout in a promise
const setDelay = (delay) => {
  console.log(`delaying ${delay}`);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // throw if we have to wait too long
    if (delay > 500) {
      throw "we'll wait too long";
    }

    setTimeout(() => {
      // timeout is over, resolve
      resolve();
    }, delay);
  });
};

setDelay(randomNumber())
  .then(() => {
    console.log('all done with delay');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log('catching error');
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## `.all`

Sometimes we may wish to wait for a set of Promises to resolve that do not need to execute sequentially. With `.then` syntax, we are forced to wait for these Promises to resolve sequentially, which can slow down our program. With `.all`, we can allow the Promises to execute in parallel, and only run the following code in program after all specified Promises have resolved.

### Resolve Unrelated DB Query Promises in Parallel

```javascript
const results = Promise.all([
  pool.query('SELECT * FROM recipes'),
  pool.query('SELECT * FROM users'),
  pool.query('SELECT * FROM categories'),
  // allResults is an array of results whose elements correspond
  // to the elements in the Promise.all parameter array
]).then((allResults) => {
  console.log(allResults);
});
```

### Comparison of Sequential vs Parallel Promise Resolution

The following example is a simulation of sequential vs parallel execution time.

#### Sequential Promise Resolution

The delay will be the sum of all the delays.

```javascript
const randomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

const setDelay = (delay) => {
  console.log(`delaying ${delay}`);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(delay), delay);
  });
};

// do nested setTimeouts, one after the other
const result = setDelay(randomNumber()).then((resultOne) => {
  return setDelay(randomNumber()).then((resultTwo) => {
    return setDelay(randomNumber()).then((resultThree) => {
      return setDelay(randomNumber());
    });
  });
});

// run this when they are all done
result.then((lastDelay) => {
  console.log('all done');
  console.log(lastDelay);
});
```

#### Parallel Promise Resolution with `Promise.all`

The delay will be as long as the longest delay.

```javascript
const randomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

const setDelay = (delay) => {
  console.log(`delaying: ${delay}`);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(delay), delay);
  });
};

// start all the setTimeouts
// results is a Promise that resolves to an array of values that
// correspond to the resolve values of each element in the Promise.all
// parameter array.
const results = Promise.all([
  setDelay(randomNumber()),
  setDelay(randomNumber()),
  setDelay(randomNumber()),
  setDelay(randomNumber()),
]);

results.then((arrayOfResolvedValues) => {
  console.log('all done');
  console.log(arrayOfResolvedValues);
});
```

## Exercise

Run the [Comparison of Sequential vs Parallel Promise Resolution](0.8.1-promise.prototype.catch-promise.all.md#comparison-of-sequential-vs-parallel-promise-resolution) code examples above and compare sequential vs parallel processing time.
