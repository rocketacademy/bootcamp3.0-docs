## Curriculum Outline

Rocket's Bootcamp contains 4 modules of 16 course days each, each of which culminates in a project. Rocket requires students complete module projects to continue in Coding Bootcamp.

1. Frontend
   1. Build UI with HTML, React and CSS (individual project)
2. Full Stack
   1. Build full-stack app with Firebase backend (group project)
3. Backend
   1. Build full-stack app with Express backend (individual or group project)
4. Capstone
   1. Build app with new technology (individual or group project)

The following is a diagram of Rocket's curriculum. Module 1 introduces the relationship between client and server and how a frontend server can serve a client-side application. Module 2 introduces a 3rd-party backend service (Firebase) that our frontend apps can use to store data. Module 3 introduces how to build a backend service of our own. Throughout the course we will learn algorithms to bolster our foundations and prepare for SWE interviews.
