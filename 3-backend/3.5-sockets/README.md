# 3.5: Sockets

Web Sockets are an internet technology that _**is not based on HTTP requests**_. They exist to solve the problem of not wanting to make a round trip request-response pattern to do some action. Web sockets allow one-way communication between the front-end and back-end. You no longer have to either, send something and wait for a response, or make a request in order to know something about what happened.

Some examples:

- sending a notification to all logged in users
- receiving a chat message
- telling the user they lost the card game
