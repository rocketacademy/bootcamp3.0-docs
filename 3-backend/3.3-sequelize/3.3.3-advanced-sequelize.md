# 3.3.3: Advanced Sequelize

## Learning Objectives

1. Constraints and validations
2. Aliases and custom foreign keys
3. Multiple associations with same models
4. Eager loading

## Introduction

Sequelize allows us to define rules for what data we can store in our DB with database constraints and model validations. The DB checks DB constraints at the DB level, i.e. on the DB server, and our app checks model validations at the app level, i.e. on our app servers. Generally we will want both DB constraints and model validations so our system is most robust.
