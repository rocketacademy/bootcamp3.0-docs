# 3.3.2: Sequelize M-M Relationships

## Introduction

Similar to one-to-many associations, Sequelize enables many-to-many associations through under-the-hood foreign key dereferencing. See [Query Associated Tables](3.3.2-sequelize-m-m-relationships.md#query-associated-tables-in-sequelize) section below for how our many-to-many business logic might look with Sequelize.
