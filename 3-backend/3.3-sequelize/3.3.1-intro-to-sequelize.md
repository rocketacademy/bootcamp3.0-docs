# 3.3.1: Intro to Sequelize

## Introduction

Sequelize allows us to specify all aspects of our DB schema with JavaScript and provides methods to generate and run SQL queries. This module summarises the setup and core features of Sequelize.

Sequelize is an abstraction on top of SQL and Postgres. When we call a Sequelize method to query the DB, it performs the following steps.

1. Sequelize generates a SQL query using the invoked Sequelize method and relevant parameters
2. Sequelize runs that SQL query through the Pg library, as we have been doing in previous modules
3. Pg executes that SQL query on the connected Postgres DB

## Setup Packages and Folders

<details>

<summary>Setup Packages</summary>

**Create App**

Create a directory for your app and initialize NPM.

```bash
npm init -y
```

**Install Sequelize NPM Packages**

Install `sequelize` and `pg` NPM packages to use Sequelize with Postgres in our app. Sequelize requests that we install `pg` manually because Sequelize also supports other SQL database types such as MySQL and SQLite, and does not install any SQL DB connectors such as `pg` by default to keep the Sequelize library lean.

Install `sequelize-cli` NPM package in development dependencies to generate relevant Sequelize files such as migrations and models from the command line. `sequelize-cli` also allows us to run Sequelize migration files that will update our DB schema in lieu of raw SQL.

```
npm install pg sequelize
npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli
```

**Create Sequelize Folders**

Create the empty folders `config`, `migrations`, `models`, and `seeders`. These will store Sequelize files that we will need to create for our application. We will explore what each of these folders represents below. We can also create these folders with the [`npx sequelize init`](https://github.com/sequelize/cli#usage) command. More on this [here](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html#project-bootstrapping).

```bash
mkdir config migrations models seeders
```

</details>

## Configure Database

<details>

<summary>Configure Database</summary>

### Create Database Connection Config File

Similar to the `pg` connection config we defined in [Module 3.5.2: PostgreSQL Node App](../../3-backend-applications/3.4-sql-applications/3.4.2-postgresql-node-app.md#pg-npm-library), the Sequelize connection config specifies parameters for Sequelize to connect to our SQL database. We use JS for our config file so that we can include inline comments, unlike JSON.

**Sample Config File (config/config.js)**

module.exports is the instruction that tells Node.js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to “export” from a given file so other files are allowed to access the exported code.

This file tells the sequelize cli how to connect to the database.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // development settings, other settings include staging and production settings which we have not included here
  development: {
    username: "kai",
    password: null,
    // "grocery" is our example app name, which we also use as our DB name.
    // Use "_development" suffix to indicate DB is for development purposes (naming convention)
    database: "grocery_development",
    host: "127.0.0.1",
    dialect: "postgres",
  },
};
```

**Create Database Based on Config**

Create the database specified in the config using Sequelize CLI's built-in command `db:create`.

```
npx sequelize db:create
```

this is the result you should see on your terminal after running the command `npx sequelize db:create`

```
Sequelize CLI [Node: 15.14.0, CLI: 6.3.0, ORM: 6.12.0-alpha.1]
​
Loaded configuration file "config/config.js".
Using environment "development".
Database grocery_development created
```

</details>

## Create Tables (Migrations)

<details>

<summary>Create Tables (Migrations)</summary>

Sequelize replaces `init_tables.sql` from Module [3.5.7: Database Setup Files](../../3-backend-applications/3.4-sql-applications/3.4.9-database-setup-files.md#init_tables-sql) with a concept called "**migrations**". Database migrations are a system to manage database schema, allowing us to specify changes to database tables and columns over the lifetime of our database.

Database migrations only manipulate database schema, but do not determine how our applications interact with the database. Database "**models**" in the following section determine how our apps interact with the DB.

Migrations are especially crucial to manage changes to DB schema after our apps go live and contain real-user data. Migrations help us create and run SQL queries to update our schema, while maintaining a record of the update in a "migration file" and in the DB itself. This helps prevent incorrect SQL caused by human error, and helps us keep track of DB state.

Migrations also allow us to quickly re-create copies of our DB by "replaying" all of our migration files in chronological order. This is especially useful for testing and feature development, because it eliminates human error in re-creating DBs with SQL queries. It also enables fellow developers to easily run your written migrations on their own local database setup, and therefore anyone with your code could use your app.

**Create Migration to Create Items Table**

Use `sequelize-cli`'s `migration:generate` command to create a new migration. This specific migration is to create an `Items` table in our database.

Note that the table name `items` is in snake_case and pluralised, as per SQL naming convention from [Module 3.5.2: PostgreSQL Node App](../../3-backend-applications/3.4-sql-applications/3.4.2-postgresql-node-app.md#sql-entity-naming-and-casing). Column names are also snake_case. You may notice in the Models section below that corresponding model attributes are in camelCase. This camelCase-snake_case translation is done by the `underscored` Sequelize option specified in the model file. This allows us to use camel case in JavaScript and snake case in SQL, satisfying casing conventions for both languages.

Sequelize expects table names to be plural, and model names to be singular, and automatically queries for table names that are pluralised forms of our model names in our apps.

```
npx sequelize migration:generate --name create-items-table
```

Replace the contents of the generated file with the following table-creation code. Sequelize is Promise-based, and uses async/await syntax to manipulate async control flow in migration files by default. `queryInterface` is a param provided by Sequelize to manipulate DB schema. See [`queryInterface` docs](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/query-interface.html) for more info.

You may notice that there is an `up` and a `down` section of each migration. The `up` section runs when we execute the migration on the DB. `down` runs when we wish to undo the most recently run migration, which should only be done in rare circumstances and almost never in production.

Note that `created_at` and `updated_at` are required columns with Sequelize.

**Migration File Template**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('<TABLE_NAME_SNAKE_CASE_PLURAL>', {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
      },
      <COLUMN_NAME_SNAKE_CASE>: {
        type: Sequelize.<COLUMN_DATA_TYPE_UPPERCASE>,
      },
      // ... [<OTHER_COLUMNS>]
      // created_at and updated_at are required
      created_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
      updated_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },

    });
  },

  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('<TABLE_NAME_SNAKE_CASE_PLURAL>');
  },
};
```

**Sample Migration File (\<GENERATED_DATE>-create-items-table.js)**

```javascript
// running "npx sequelize migration:generate --name create-items-table" creates this file
// something like this should appear in the terminal after running this command
​
// Sequelize CLI [Node: 15.14.0, CLI: 6.3.0, ORM: 6.12.0-alpha.1]
​
// migrations folder at "/home/michellemok/RA/ftbc5/sequelize/migrations" already exists.
// New migration was created at /home/michellemok/RA/ftbc5/sequelize/migrations/20211203063853-create-items-table.js .

module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('items', {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
      },
      name: {
        type: Sequelize.STRING,
      },
      // created_at and updated_at are required
      created_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
      updated_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
    });
  },

  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('items');
  },
};
```

Should you encounter any errors when running the command below, you might need to remove all comments above `module.exports` in the sample file above.

**Run Migration to Create Table**

Writing the migration file specifies the DB schema changes. To execute all unexecuted migration files, run `sequelize-cli`'s `db:migrate` command.

```
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

This command will execute these steps:

- Will ensure a table called `SequelizeMeta` in database. This table is used to record which migrations have run on the current database
- Start looking for any migration files which haven't run yet. Files which have already run will not run again. This is possible by checking `SequelizeMeta` table(by running the command: `select * from "SequelizeMeta"`). In this case it will run `XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-create-user.js` migration, which we created in last step.
- Creates a table called Items with all columns as specified in its migration file.

The passed queryInterface object can be used to modify the database. The Sequelize object stores the available data types such as STRING or INTEGER (https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/ data-types.html)

queryInterface comes from `const queryInterface = sequelize.getQueryInterface();`

refer to docs, https://sequelize.org/master/manual/query-interface.html

</details>

## Further explanation of migrations

<details>

<summary>Further Explanations of Migrations</summary>

We can create more than 1 migration file by running `sequelize migration:generate` again.

For example, if we wanted to change the name of the table we previously created, we could run the command `to create another migration file`:

`sequelize migration:generate --name change-items-table-name`

```
// this file was created after running the command "npx sequelize migration:generate --name change-items-table-name" (2nd migration file)
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.renameTable('items', 'things');
  },
​
  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.renameTable('things', 'items');
  },
};
​
```

After running `npx sequelize db:migrate`, this should be seen in the command terminal:

```
 Sequelize CLI [Node: 15.14.0, CLI: 6.3.0, ORM: 6.12.0-alpha.1]
​

// it tells us that the file we just created ran, and we should see the following in the SequelizeMeta table:
                    name

  20211206124409-change-items-table-name.js
  (2 rows)

// checking the database in psql should show us that the name of the table has changed:

  public | SequelizeMeta | table    | michellemok
  public | items_id_seq  | sequence | michellemok
  public | things        | table    | michellemok
 (3 rows)
​
```

To undo migrations, we can run the `npx sequelize db:migrate:undo` command. See [Sequelize CLI docs](https://github.com/sequelize/cli#usage) for a full list of Sequelize CLI commands. This command will only undo the most recent `up` migration, by running the `down` function of that migration file. Ideally we should always write the `down` function to be the regression of the `up` function. For example `up` would create a table, `down` would delete that table.

```
// if we want to undo the changes made by running the migration, we can run the command "npx sequelize db:migrate:undo"
// and we should see the following in the command line:
​

```

**Verify Table Creation in Psql**

Open Psql with a connection to our DB

```
psql -d grocery_development
```

Run `\dt` to display tables in the DB

```bash
\dt
```

</details>

## Models

<details>

<summary>Models</summary>

Models enable our Node applications to interact with the DB by defining what data is available. Model "**classes**" (in UpperCamelCase) have methods that allow us to query the corresponding DB tables, which must be named as the pluralised form of our model names. Model "**instances**" (in lowerCamelCase) are instantiations of those classes, and are essentially JavaScript objects with pre-defined attributes, where those attributes are defined in model files and map to the corresponding DB table's columns. Models assume that the DB schema is already set up as per what is defined in the model files. **Models do not manipulate DB schema; only migrations manipulate DB schema.**

**Create Model File for Item Model**

In the previous section we wrote and ran a migration to create the `items` table. Now we will define an `Item` model to let our application access the data inside the `items` table.

A model file is essentially a JavaScript class generator that specifies the name of a model and its attributes and associations. Sequelize models correspond directly to DB tables, where the model name should always be the singular form of the table name since the model is a representation of a single instance or a single row of that table. For example, the model corresponding to the `items` table must be called "item" in the sequelize definition for Sequelize to work. Sequelize uses model names to generate table names when it translates JavaScript to SQL queries.

**Model File Template (models/\<MODEL_NAME_LOWERCASE_SINGULAR>.mjs)**

Note the usage of .mjs file extensions in Modules 4.2.x. This is in lieu of `"type": "module"` in package.json. The .mjs extension lets Node know to treat the file as an ES6 module instead of a CommonJS file.

```javascript
export default function init<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>Model(sequelize, DataTypes) {
  return sequelize.define('<MODEL_NAME_SNAKE_CASE_SINGULAR>', {
    id: {
      allowNull: false,
      autoIncrement: true,
      primaryKey: true,
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    },
    <COLUMN_NAME>: {
      type: Sequelize.<COLUMN_DATA_TYPE_UPPERCASE>,
    },
    // ... [<OTHER_COLUMNS>]
    createdAt: {
      allowNull: false,
      type: DataTypes.DATE,
    },
    updatedAt: {
      allowNull: false,
      type: DataTypes.DATE,
    },
  }, {
    // The underscored option makes Sequelize reference snake_case names in the DB.
    underscored: true
  });
};
```

**Sample Model File (models/item.mjs)**

```javascript
//  a model represents a table in sequelize, The model tells Sequelize several things about the entity it represents, such as the name of the table in the database and which columns it has (and their data types).
// To define mappings between a model and a table, use the define method
//  After being defined, we can access our model with sequelize.models.Item, i.e,
//  Item === sequelize.models.Item
​
// this function is exported and used in line 37 of index.mjs,
// db.Item = initItemModel(sequelize, Sequelize.DataTypes);
// it takes 2 parameters, the instance of Sequelize (sequelize) that we created in index.mjs and Sequelize.Datatypes(https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html), which allow us to specify what type of data we want
export default function initItemModel(sequelize, DataTypes) {
  return sequelize.define(
    'item',
    {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      },
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
      },
      createdAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: DataTypes.DATE,
      },
      updatedAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: DataTypes.DATE,
      },
    },
    {
      // The underscored option makes Sequelize reference snake_case names in the DB.
      underscored: true,
    }
  );
}
```

Should you encounter any errors when running the command below, you might need to remove all comments above `module.exports` in the sample file above.

**Create Model Index File to Make Models Accessible in App**

We will initialise and export all the models we define in a single module. This makes it easy to access models from different modules within our application. In the following code, model classes are exported in a `db` object where keys are model names and values are model classes. The following is a simplified version of the model index file generated by [`npx sequelize init`](https://github.com/sequelize/cli#usage).

**Model Index File Template**

```javascript
import sequelizePackage from 'sequelize';
import allConfig from '../config/config.js';

import init<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>Model from './<MODEL_NAME_LOWER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>.mjs';

const { Sequelize } = sequelizePackage;
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
const config = allConfig[env];
const db = {};

let sequelize = new Sequelize(config.database, config.username, config.password, config);

db.<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR> = init<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>Model(sequelize, Sequelize.DataTypes);

db.sequelize = sequelize;
db.Sequelize = Sequelize;

export default db;
```

**Sample Model Index File (models/index.mjs)**

```javascript
import sequelizePackage from "sequelize";
// we give the name allConfig to what we're importing from config.js, i.e, our database settings
import allConfig from "../config/config.js";

import initItemModel from "./item.mjs";

const { Sequelize } = sequelizePackage;
// in this case, "env" will be development, as we have in our config.js file
// process.env.NODE_ENV will be used later on in the course
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || "development";
// this is the same as saying :
// const config = allConfig['development']
const config = allConfig[env];
const db = {};

// initiate a new instance of Sequelize
// note similarity to pool.query

let sequelize = new Sequelize(
  // database settings from config.js
  config.database,
  config.username,
  config.password,
  config
);

// here we are putting initItemModel from item.mjs into the object "db" (line 14)
db.Item = initItemModel(sequelize, Sequelize.DataTypes);
// db = {
//    Item: initItemModel(sequelize, Sequelize.DataTypes)
// }

// here we are putting the instance we created in line 28 into the object "db"
db.sequelize = sequelize;
// db = {
//     Item: initItemModel(sequelize, Sequelize.DataTypes),
//    sequelize: sequelize
// }

export default db;
```

**One command to create a migration and a model**

Now that we have all our code setup, we understood what migrations and models are, and how to set them up, let's look at how to create a migration and a model at the same time with a single command

```bash
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Item --attributes name:string
```

After running this command, you should see a new migration and a new model file in the respective folders. Please note, that this command currently only allows for a basic setup, and not for more advanced attributes to be added to your properties. You will have to do that on your own, if you have these requirements for your columns/properties.

## Use Sequelize in App Logic

<details>

<summary>Use Sequelize in App Logic</summary>

**Node App to Create Item**

Before we use Sequelize with Express, let's create a command-line Node app that creates an `item` entry in the database using Sequelize.

**Node App File Template**

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

db.<MODEL_NAME_CAPITALIZED_SINGULAR>
  .create({
    <COLUMN_NAME>: <VALUE>,
    [<OTHER_COLUMN_NAMES_AND_VALUES>]
  })
  .then((<RESULT_ROW>) => {
    console.log('success!');
    console.log(<RESULT_ROW>);
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

**Sample Node App File (create.mjs)**

Sequelize's `create` method generates an `INSERT` query based on the `Item` model we defined above. This inserts a record with the name provided on the command line to the `items` table in our DB.

```javascript
// import the object we created with everything in it from index.mjs
import db from "./models/index.mjs";

// a model is an ES6 class. An instance of the class represents one object from that model (which maps to one row of the table in the database).
//  Although a model is a class, you should not create instances by using the new operator directly. Sequelize provides the create method for this
// https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-instances.html

db.Item.create({
  name: process.argv[2],
})
  .then((item) => {
    console.log("success!");
    console.log(item);
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

Let's run this app to create an Item in the DB.

**Node Command Template**

```
node create.mjs <ITEM_NAME>
```

**Sample Node Command**

```
node create.mjs milk
```

Let's verify that this Item now exists in the DB. Open Psql with a connection to our DB

```
psql -d grocery_development
```

Verify that we inserted our Item in the DB

```
SELECT * FROM "items";
```

**Node App to Retrieve Items**

Let's create another command-line app to retrieve data from our DB using the model-querying functionality of Sequelize.

**Model Query Node App Template**

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

db.<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>.findAll({
  where: {
    <MODEL_COLUMN_NAME>: ['milk']
  }
})
.then((items) => console.log(items[0]))
.catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

**Sample Model Query Node App (where.mjs)**

`findAll` method accepts an options object as a parameter that allows us to specify WHERE attributes that we would previously put in our SQL statements.

```javascript
import db from "./models/index.mjs";

db.Item.findAll({
  where: {
    name: [process.argv[2]],
  },
})
  .then((items) => console.log(items[0]))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

Let's run this app the retrieve Items from the DB

```bash
node where.mjs milk
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Why do Sequelize models and migrations look the same?**\
\*\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*When we begin a project, we'll start with a migration of all the tables we have models for. During bootcamp, when changes are made to the database structure these two files can simply be edited to mirror each other.

An alternate workflow is to use a new migration file for each new change to the database. A migration will help preserve the data in a deployed Heroku database, but this would likely be unnecessary, since even during a Bootcamp project, there is likely no "real" user generated data inside the deployed Heroku database.

Sequelize has a setting to automate this duplication between model and migration called [sync](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#model-synchronization)- this setting eliminates the need for migrations at all by syncing the models to the database.

However, in production when we need to control the \*running production database\* separately from our models, migrations become important because the database is not in the repo, and in a production environment there is a need to be very, very careful with live user data. Migrations allow a workflow where incremental changes can be made against the live database, ensuring the most careful workflow possible. The default Sequelize sync functionalities do not allow for this.\
