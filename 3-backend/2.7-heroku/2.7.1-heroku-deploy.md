# 3.7.1: Heroku Deploy

## Introduction

Heroku works by tying your repo to it's deployment system. You `git push` your repo to the Heroku remote and Heroku runs a set of predetermined scripts so that your app is up and running. You can see their [detailed docs here.](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs?singlepage=true)

Heroku and GitHub are not linked by default. If we want to push our code to GitHub, we need run a separate push command from the command to deploy our code to Heroku.

## Install Heroku Command Line Tools

Follow install instructions here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-with-an-installer

Login to the service through the command line:

```text
heroku login
```

We're going to deploy an example app to demonstrate Heroku.

## Example App Repo Setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following setup is only for the example repo in this module. There is no need to remove or add remotes for our project repos.
{% endhint %}

1. Clone the example app starter code.

   ```text
   git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/heroku-example.git
   ```

2. `cd` inside.

   ```text
   cd heroku-example
   ```

3. Create a new repo on your own GitHub account.
4. Remove the Rocket Academy origin URL from the local cloned repo.

   ```text
   git remote remove origin
   ```

5. Set the origin of the local cloned repo to your new GitHub repo. Note this is the HTTPS link with .git at the end.

   ```text
   git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
   ```

6. Push the code to your new repo.

   ```text
   git push origin main
   ```

## Configure Express for Heroku

We need to make a few changes to our Express app to make it work on Heroku. Before we make these changes, let's make sure our app works locally. The following assumes we've setup the example app as per above instructions.

```text
npm install
npx nodemon index.js
```

Visit [http://localhost:3004/bananas](http://localhost:3004/bananas) and verify our server works.

### Port

We need to add the ability of Heroku to configure the port that Express.js is listening on. \(We can't set it ourselves, and it's not 80 - our Express.js app will not be directly listening for incoming internet traffic. There is an internal Heroku server that is listening on port 80 and forwarding traffic to our Express.js server instance.

Heroku configures the port internally by using a `PORT` environment variable. Update index.js to read from `process.env.PORT`, and set port to 3004 only if `PORT` env var doesn't exist, e.g. on our local machines.

#### index.js

```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3004;
```

### Start Script

Heroku needs to know what command to run to start the system. By default Heroku looks for a `start` script in package.json for Node.js apps. Add `start` to the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

#### package.json

```javascript
 "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "node test.js"
  },
```

Commit these changes to your repo. Test them to make sure your app still runs locally.

## Heroku

Now we'll associate the repo with Heroku \(run this on your laptop\):

```bash
heroku create
```

Check to see the new remote Heroku has created for you:

```text
git remote -v
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-10-at-4.37.20-pm.png)

`push` the repo code to Heroku:

```text
git push heroku main
```

This command will set off the Heroku scripts that activate and run your app. You'll see them running in the terminal.

The terminal output will tell you what the URL of your new app is.

## Create React App \(For Future Reference\)

In [Module 8.1](../../8-advanced-react/8.1-create-react-app/) we learn about Create React App \(CRA\), a pre-packaged Node.js app with React pre-installed. CRA deployment works slightly differently from regular Heroku development in [2.7.1: Heroku Deploy](2.7.1-heroku-deploy.md). If you're reading this page to deploy a CRA app, please follow the Heroku Deployment instructions in CRA Docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#heroku) to deploy CRA apps.

Note: You may need to replace `master` branch with `main` branch in the documentation code if your repo uses `main` as the default branch.
