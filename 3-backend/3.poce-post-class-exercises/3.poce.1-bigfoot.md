# 3.E.1: Bigfoot GET

## Introduction

Create an Express.js app that displays [Bigfoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot) sightings.

## CORS

### Introduction

When we deploy our app across multiple servers (frontend and backend), we will need to allow them to communicate with each other. To allow our frontend to communicate with our backend, we add [Express CORS middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) as a dependency and use it in `index.mjs`. [Here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L12-L15) is a link to the code.

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  credentials: true,
  origin: FRONTEND_URL
}));
```

CORS is a security feature of modern browsers that disallows AJAX requests to a domain that is different from the originating domain. This is to prevent attackers from pretending to be a legit client and stealing data from our backend servers.

In our case, our requests originate from localhost:3000 and we want to request data from our backend server at localhost:3004. These are different "origins", thus our browsers will disallow these requests by default. To enable such requests, we will need to enable CORS settings server-side. This will let browsers know that the target server allows such cross-origin requests, such that browsers allow such requests to be sent.

CORS security has both client-side and server-side components. The server controls which domains to whitelist. The client first checks its whitelist status with the target server using a "pre-flight request" before sending the actual request from the user application. If the pre-flight request fails due to CORS, the client browser will prevent the actual request from sending, citing CORS as the reason.

### CORS with cookies

We need special CORS settings to pass auth information such as cookies between our frontend and backend.

#### Backend

We specify the frontend server URL with the following code ([link](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L7)):

```javascript
const FRONTEND_URL = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

And we tell `cors` to accept cookie credentials from that frontend server URL with the following code ([link](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L13-L14)):

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  credentials: true,
  origin: FRONTEND_URL
}));
```

#### Frontend

We tell our frontend to send cookie credentials to other servers (non-origin domains) in `axios` requests with the following code ([link](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L10-L11)). We will need to specify the following setting in every file where we import and use `axios`.

```javascript
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

## Setup

Clone the [Rocket Bigfoot Express repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/bigfoot-express-bootcamp). This repo contains a `data.json` file with Bigfoot sighting data.

## Base

### Get Sighting By Index

When the server receives a request to `/sightings/<INDEX>`, respond with the sighting in `data.json` that corresponds to the index in the URL.

#### Sample Request URL

```
http://localhost:3004/sightings/0
```

### Respond with HTML

Update the request handler callback to respond with HTML.

#### Sample Response with HTML

```javascript
app.get("/sightings/:index", (request, response) => {
  const content = `
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>hello</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
  `;
  response.send(content);
});
```

### Include Bigfoot Sighting Data in Response HTML

1. After successfully responding with HTML, use `${}` expressions in template literals to include sighting information such as `YEAR`, `STATE`, and `OBSERVED` attributes in the HTML response.
2. Verify we send the correct HTML response by sending a request with `curl`.

### Discussion Questions

1. What happens if the server does not send a response? What does that look like in the Chrome Network tab?
2. What happens if we send 2 responses from the same request handler, e.g. 2 calls to `response.send`?
3. What are other attributes in the Express `request` and `response` objects? `console.log` them to see.
4. Add an Express routing method to `/apple` that responds with "hello". Add another routing method to `/apple` (the same path) below the 1st that responds with "goodbye". Make a request to `/apple`. Notice that the request handler from the 1st routing method executes and not the 2nd. Verify this by moving the 2nd routing method above the 1st.
5. What are other methods we can call on the Express `response` object? Read more in Express docs [here](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res).

## Comfortable

1. Create a route that lists all reports for a given year.
2. To prevent information overload, only display year and state information for each report in the list.
3. No need to format output in HTML.

#### Sample Request URL

```
http://localhost:3004/year-sightings/1989
```

## More Comfortable

### Sort By

1. Use query params to determine how to sort the list of reports.
2. The list should be sorted by state by default. The query param can determine if we should sort results in ascending or descending order.
3. No need to format output in HTML.

#### Sample Request URL

```
http://localhost:3004/year-sightings?sort=asc
```

We can retrieve the `sort` query param from the `request.query` object provided by Express in the request handler middleware function. Read more on Express query params [here](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query).
