# 3.E.4: Bigfoot SQL M-M

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand how to set up M-M relationships in a SQL database using models and migrations with foreign keys and junction tables
2. Understand how to query M-M relationship data with Sequelize
3. Understand how to access data in the junction table using Sequelize

## Introduction

We will add categories to our Bigfoot sightings to make it easier for researchers to categorise sighting data. There will be an M-M relationship between categories and sightings.

## Setup

## Submission

## Deployment

### Heroku deploy instructions

Deploying the [base MVC (and Webpack) app](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp) is the same as deploying previous apps to Heroku with one difference- the database.

When using Sequelize we need to have different configs for connecting to the Heroku Postgres instance. Those configs are here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/main/config/config.js#L9-L19](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/main/config/config.js#L9-L19)

```javascript
// ...
//
production: {
  use_env_variable: 'DATABASE_URL',
  dialect: 'postgres',
  protocol: 'postgres',
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: { // https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/12083
      require: true,
      rejectUnauthorized: false,
    },
  },
},
// ...
```

and here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/main/models/index.mjs#L12-L24](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/main/models/index.mjs#L12-L24)

```javascript
if (env === "production") {
  // Break apart the Heroku database url and rebuild the configs we need
  const { DATABASE_URL } = process.env;
  const dbUrl = url.parse(DATABASE_URL);
  const username = dbUrl.auth.substr(0, dbUrl.auth.indexOf(":"));
  const password = dbUrl.auth.substr(
    dbUrl.auth.indexOf(":") + 1,
    dbUrl.auth.length
  );
  const dbName = dbUrl.path.slice(1);
  const host = dbUrl.hostname;
  const { port } = dbUrl;
  config.host = host;
  config.port = port;
  sequelize = new Sequelize(dbName, username, password, config);
}
```

These are all included configs that don't need to be changed.

### Initialising the DB

To get your Sequelize database running on Heroku, run the Sequelize commands within the Heroku system. (No need to create the database, that's already been done when you provision the Postgres add-on.)

```
heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

```
heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```
