# 3.E.5: Carousell Schema Design

## Learning Objectives

1. Know how to create an ERD for an app
2. Know how to design SQL database schema for 2-sided marketplace like Carousell

## Introduction

We will create a database ERD for Carousell, a 2-sided buyer and seller marketplace. We will still only use 1-M and M-M relationships, but we will see different ways to associate tables with a different use case.

## Setup

If you haven't already, create a [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) account and create a new diagram for this exercise. Choose PostgreSQL when asked what SQL dialect we are using.

## Base: Users Buy and Sell Products with Listings

**Sequelize `STRING` data type maps to `VARCHAR` in DrawSQL and PostgreSQL**

The Sequelize `STRING` data type maps to `VARCHAR` in DrawSQL and PostgreSQL. See [Sequelize Data Types docs](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-basics/#data-types) for what Postgres data types each Sequelize data type maps to.
