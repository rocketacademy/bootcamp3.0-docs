# 3.E.6: Carousell Auth

## Learning Objectives

1. Know how to implement industry-standard authentication in an app with a SQL backend

## Introduction

We will implement authentication in a simple Carousell clone that allows users to login, view, list and buy items. Users can browse items without logging in, but will need to login to list or buy items.

## Setup

### Fork and clone repos

Fork and clone Rocket Academy's [Carousell Frontend](https://github.com/rocketacademy/carousell-frontend-bootcamp) and [Carousell Backend](https://github.com/rocketacademy/carousell-backend-bootcamp) repos.

Rocket has set up starter code such that users can:

1. View listings from the home page
2. List new items by clicking on "Sell" from the home page
3. Buy items by clicking "Buy" at the bottom of item-specific pages

The starter code follows the structure of our Bigfoot frontend and backend. Rocket followed backend setup instructions in Bigfoot SQL to set up the backend.

### Setup frontend

Run `npm i` to install packages

### Setup backend

1. Run `npm i` to install packages
2. Update `config/database.json` to use your Unix username instead of `kai`
3. Run `npx sequelize db:create` to create the `carousell_development` database
4. Run `npx sequelize db:migrate` to set up database schema
5. Run `npx sequelize db:seed:all` to seed users and listings in the database
6. Verify seed data was added by viewing the `Users` and `Listings` table in our SQL client

### Verify starter code is working

1. Start the backend with `npm start`
2. Start the frontend with `npm start`, and select `y` to start it on port `3001` because the backend is running on port `3000`
3. Verify we do not get errors in our backend or frontend, and we can see 3 seed listings at `localhost:3001` in our browser. Click on a listing to view its details. Buy and sell listings to observe what happens, and notice that the buyer and seller IDs have been hard-coded to 1 (the seed user).

## Base: Require authentication to create listings and buy items

We will now put the theory we learnt in Rocket's Authentication submodule into practice.

### Setup backend API authorisation

Refer to the [official Auth0 Express Authorization guide](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/nodejs/01-authorization) as a reference.

1. Navigate to the API section of the Auth0 dashboard (under Applications in the left navbar) and click Create API
2. Choose a name and identifier for our API. Rocket named ours Carousell API and used `https://carousell/api` as our identifier. Leave the signing algorithm as RS256.
3. After creating the API we should see a Quick Start page. Ignore sample code on that page because it uses outdated libraries. We will be following setup instructions in the official Auth0 guide instead, which uses a [new library that replaced the outdated libraries](https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-oauth2-express-sdk-protecting-api-with-jwt/).
4. Back in the official Auth0 guide, skip the section on defining permissions for now. By default all authenticated users will be able to list and buy items in our app.
5. Install `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer`, Auth0's new, simplified library for verifying authentication
6. Import the `auth` property of `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer` in our app like in the code example in the Auth0 guide. Note that Rocket's app setup requires `import` syntax instead of `require` syntax. Copy the `checkJwt` variable definition and replace `YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER` with the API identifier we chose above.
7. Add `checkJwt` as a middleware between the route path and route handler function for our create-new-listing and buy-listing routes. See sample code under Protect API Endpoints section of Auth0 guide for reference. `checkJwt` will validate authentication before Express runs our route handler functions.
8. No need to check scopes because we are not using scopes for now.

Testing the security of our API independently is [more work than it's worth right now](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/nodejs/02-using#obtaining-an-access-token), so we will move on and test our API together with our frontend!

### Login from frontend

We will follow the [official Auth0 guide for React apps](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login).&#x20;

1. Create a new Auth0 application in the Auth0 dashboard. Give it the name "Carousell" and choose the Single Page Web Application application type.
2. Add `http://localhost:3001` to Allowed Callback URLs, Allowed Logout URLs and Allowed Web Origins in the new application's Application Settings page. Save changes at bottom of page. If we deploy our app later, we will also need to add the deployed URL to these sections.
3. Install Auth0 React SDK with `npm i @auth0/auth0-react`
4. Configure the `Auth0Provider` higher-order component that wraps all other components in `index.js`. If we are logged in when viewing the Auth0 guide, we can choose the relevant Auth0 Application and Auth0 will auto-populate the properties we need for `Auth0Provider`.

TODO: Add login to application, no need to add logout

### Send auth tokens from frontend

We will follow the [official Auth0 API-calling guide for React apps](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/02-calling-an-api).

TODO: Setup, get access token, call API
