# 3.1.4: RESTful Routes

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and refers to a convention for what a given set of URL paths do and how they affect the data in an app.

Some of the following routes apply in an AJAX API context and some do not.

The URL path parameters are also assumed to be named exactly the same in Express.js.

The following table assumes a table (and thus Sequelize model) named with "_**photo**_". Note the pluralization.

|                  |               |                                   |                                        |                  |        |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| **URL**          | **HTTP Verb** | **Action/Controller Method Name** | Functionality                          | Format           | SQL    |
| /photos/         | GET           | index                             | Get/render a list of photos            | JSON/HTML        | SELECT |
| /photos/create   | GET           | createForm                        | Render a form to create a photo        | HTML             | n/a    |
| /photos/create   | POST          | create                            | Accept a request to create a new photo | JSON/Form Submit | INSERT |
| /photos/:id      | GET           | show                              | Get/render a single photo              | JSON/HTML        | SELECT |
| /photos/:id/edit | GET           | edit                              | Render a form to edit a photo.         | HTML             | SELECT |
| /photos/:id      | PATCH/PUT     | update                            | Accept a request to update a photo.    | JSON/Form submit | UPDATE |
| /photos/:id      | DELETE        | destroy                           | Accept a request to delete a photo.    | JSON/Form submit | DELETE |

A RESTful naming convention assumes that the method names inside the controller are the same across multiple controllers, and that the context of the controller they are in. In this case the controller would be named after "photo".

### Caveats

Of course, for every table in an app, it may not make sense to implement all seven of the URLs mentioned above. Or there may be far more than 7. REST simply gives a recommendation for thinking about how to format the routes that you do want, given that you have a DB table.

It is definitely not a prescription about how the app should work or what it should include.

### Industry examples

* Shopify uses the REST model in it's [Admin API](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2022-01/resources/order#top).
