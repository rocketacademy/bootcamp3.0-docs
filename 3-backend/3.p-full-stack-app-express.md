# 3.P: Full-Stack App (Express)

## Introduction

Build an app that solves a problem you have using React and Express. Feel free to also use any 3rd-party libraries, Firebase features, or other technologies. This project can be done individually or in a group.

## Requirements

### App

1. React App with CRA
2. Express API server that processes GET and POST requests
3. PostgreSQL DB to store data
4. Sequelize ORM to interface between API server and DB
5. At least 1 1-M and 1 M-M SQL relationship in DB schema
6. Seed data in DB seed migrations
7. JWT authentication for user login

### Other

1. Frontend deployed with provider of your choice (e.g. GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, Netlify)
2. Backend deployed with Heroku
3. Naming, casing and commenting [best practices](../general-reference/naming-casing-and-commenting-conventions.md)
4. Git commits for each feature with descriptive commit messages
5. App description in README with user stories and low-fidelity wireframes
6. Instructions in README to run app

## Ideas

As always, try to solve a problem you have. Now that we know SQL, what ideas require stricter data integrity that SQL would be helpful for? Our ideas need not be novel; they primarily need to demonstrate our ability to code well.

## Setup

Start by forking Rocket's Bootcamp Project 3 repo that contains an empty CRA app in `frontend` and an empty Express app in `backend`. This will make it easier for SLs to review your code via pull requests.

TODO(kai): Include P3 repo link, deployment instructions, how to manage CORS

## Deployment

Rocket recommends [deploying our frontend to Firebase Hosting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#firebase) as per Create React App official docs because Firebase Hosting allows for client-side routing by React Router, unlike GitHub Pages.

Rocket recommends deploying our backend to Heroku because Heroku provides an easy way to deploy servers to the cloud and connect with a managed PostgreSQL instance.

## Submission

1. Submit a pull request to Rocket's Project 3 repo
2. Add your Project 3 repo link to the [Rocket Bootcamp Projects spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZ39naj5E6mNNkQ1akR\_FgeFO\_kM6aWCAr8zqrFOkt4/edit?usp=sharing) in your batch-specific sheet. Feel free to review past student projects in previous batches' sheets.
