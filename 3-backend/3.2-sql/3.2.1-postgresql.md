# 3.2.1: PostgreSQL

## Learning Objectives

1. PostgreSQL is a popular and robust SQL dialect
2. PostgreSQL is also a database server application that typically runs on its own server

## Introduction

PostgreSQL (aka "Postgres") is a popular and robust SQL dialect that is both lightweight and feature-rich. Other popular SQL dialects include MySQL (heavy, feature-rich) and SQLite (light, less feature-rich).

Postgres is also a database server application that we will use to store and retrieve data for our apps using the Postgres language. Postgres is typically run on its own server in production for modularity (multiple apps may want to access this DB) and security (different security rules for our DB vs API server).
