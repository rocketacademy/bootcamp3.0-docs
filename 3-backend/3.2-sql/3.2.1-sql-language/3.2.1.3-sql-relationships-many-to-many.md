# 3.2.2: SQL M-M Relationships

## Learning Objectives

1. SQL M-M relationships require a junction table between the 2 related tables, where the junction table contains at least both primary keys of the related tables

## Introduction

We will now learn to associate data with many-to-many (M-M) relationships, such as sightings and categories, songs and genres, people and personality traits. In each of these pairs, both entities have many of the other entity.&#x20;

So far we have not been able to model M-M relationships because our table structures have limited us. Storing a foreign key on either of the tables in a M-M relationship would limit us, because that would imply that each row in the table with the foreign key could only belong to a single row in the related table. We do not wish to store arrays of foreign keys (or anything) in SQL columns because doing so makes querying less efficient, and we also cannot duplicate rows to specify multiple foreign key values because we cannot have multiple rows with the same ID or primary key.&#x20;

In the following hypothetical `People` table where each person has multiple (up to infinite) personality traits, it is not possible to associate each person with multiple personality traits, assuming each personality trait also belongs to many people.

| id | name  | PersonalityId |
| -- | ----- | ------------- |
| 1  | Joe   | 1             |
| 2  | Sally | 2             |

The solution is what we call a "junction" table, aka "join" or "through" table that sits "in between" the tables with an M-M relationship. This junction table consists minimally of 3 columns: `id` (typically the primary key of the junction table) and 2 foreign keys corresponding to the IDs of the tables with an M-M relationship. The junction table works well because it allows us to specify combinations of each row in both related tables without repeating any unnecessary data.

Imagine the following `People` table.

| id | name  |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Sally |

Now imagine the following `Personalities` table.

| id | trait           |
| -- | --------------- |
| 1  | Confident       |
| 2  | Detail-oriented |
| 3  | Kind            |

How would we specify that Joe is confident and detail-oriented, and Sally is confident and kind? Similarly, how would we specify that both Joe and Sally are confident? The answer is a junction table like the following.

| id | PersonId | PersonalityId |
| -- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1  | 1        | 1             |
| 2  | 1        | 2             |
| 3  | 2        | 1             |
| 4  | 2        | 3             |

Notice the junction table specifies all associations precisely without repeating any unnecessary data. This is what makes SQL M-M relationships efficient to store and to query.
