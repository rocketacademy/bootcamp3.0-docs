# 2.5: Disk Writing

## Introduction

Writing to disk allows us to save data from our JavaScript files to our hard drives, enabling that data to persist until it is explicitly deleted.

![We can make data flow from our JavaScript programs to disk and back.](../.gitbook/assets/disk-node.jpg)

## Sample Code

The following code uses the Node.js `fs` library to write data to disk.

```javascript
import { writeFile } from 'fs';

const content = 'Some content!';

// We often abbreviate "error" to "err" for concision.
const handleFileWrite = (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  // If no error, file written successfully
  console.log('success!');
};

writeFile('test.txt', content, handleFileWrite);
```

## Newlines

We can create newlines in text files by appending the  character. The following example changes the contents of the `content` variable by adding newline characters in a loop.

```javascript
let content = 'Printing 10 numbers:';
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
  // The \n character inserts a newline at that position of the string.
  content += `Random number: ${i}: ${Math.random()}\n`;
}
```

## Exercise

1. Clone [the base Node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp)
2. Run the above code.
3. Open the written file in VSCode to confirm its contents are what we expect.
