# 3.3.2: SQL Relationships (One to Many)

## Introduction

![Each category can have many recipes. Each recipe belongs to at most 1 category.](../../.gitbook/assets/one-to-many.jpg)

In SQL we can create a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of one table in another column on a different table. In this example we are giving each recipe a category. The name of the category is stored on a different table.

The udon recipe is vegan, the pasta recipe is vegan and the mee pok recipe is keto. Another way to phrase it would be that the vegan recipes are udon and pasta, and the keto recipe is mee pok. **The relationship is called one-to-many because a recipe has one category and a category has many recipes.**

At first this may seem less efficient than simply putting the name of the category into the recipe table (like we had in the noodle recipe JSON). But with SQL we can structure our data much more strictly.

**Noodle Recipe App JSON Format**

```javascript
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "label": "Udon",
      "category": "vegan"
    },
    {
      "label": "Mee Pok",
      "category": "banana"
    }
  ]
}
```

In our noodle recipe app's JSON we had a category structure that was _implicit_, i.e. there was no master list of categories. With SQL and the one-to-many relationship we will ensure that recipes can only belong to one of a set number of categories that already exist.

## Foreign Keys

Foreign keys are values that reference a primary key in another table. In this case, `category_id` is a foreign key in the `recipes` table that references the `id` primary key in the `categories` table, such that recipes can be linked to categories. 

For one-to-many relationships, there will only be a foreign key on 1 table. In our case, this is the `recipes` table. This is because categories can have multiple recipes, but each recipe can only have 1 category. Thus, we store `category_id` in the `recipes` table instead of trying to store multiple recipe IDs per category in the `categories` table.

There is also a Postgres data type called foreign key, but we won't use this for now to keep our applications simple. This Postgres foreign key refers to a database application server feature that throws errors if foreign key rules are violated.

## DB Setup Examples

### Create Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, label TEXT, category_id INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE categories (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
```

{% hint style="info" %}
`SERIAL` data type is an auto-incrementing integer data type in Postgres, commonly used for `id` fields. Read more about `SERIAL` [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-data-types/#:\~:text=Integer%20\(%20INT%20\)%20is%20a%204,or%20AUTOINCREMENT%20column%20in%20SQLite.).
{% endhint %}

### Create Records

```sql
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('vegan');
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('keto');
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('nut free');
```

### Check IDs

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
```

### Create Recipes and Associate with Categories

```sql
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Udon', 1);
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Mee Pok', 2);
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Pasta', 1);
```

## DB Query Examples

### Get All Vegan Recipes

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE category_id=1;
```

### Get Udon Category Name

We saw that the Udon Recipe belongs to Category 1 from the previous query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE id=1;
```
