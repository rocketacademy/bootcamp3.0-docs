# 3.3.4: Inner Join

## Introduction

![An inner join will return a subset of 2 SQL tables](../../.gitbook/assets/join-venn.jpg)

The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables. We will see examples of this in this module.

JOINs only apply to SELECT queries and not other kinds of queries like INSERT.

## Setup

To follow along with the queries in this module, set up `recipes` and `categories` tables as per the following.

Create `recipes` and `categories` tables. Note that the foreign key `category_id` is in the `recipes` table because each category can have many recipes but each recipe can only have 1 category. If we wanted the foreign key in the `categories` table, we would need to store an array of `recipe_id`s in `categories`, which violates our SQL rule of no data structures in table cells.

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, label TEXT, category_id INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE categories (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
```

Create category records:

```sql
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('vegan');
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('keto');
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('nut free');
```

Check which IDs have been assigned:

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
```

Associate and create some recipes:

```sql
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Udon', 1);
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Mee Pok', 2);
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Pasta', 1);
```

## Sample Queries

### Inner Join on ID

This query gets specific columns from the `recipes` and `categories` tables where `categories.id` is the same as `recipes.category_id`. Note the format of &lt;TABLE\_NAME&gt;.&lt;COLUMN\_NAME&gt; to reference columns in a specific table. To use this naming format, the relevant tables need to be reference either in the `FROM` or `JOIN` sections of the SQL query.

```sql
 SELECT recipes.id, recipes.label, recipes.category_id, categories.id, categories.name
 FROM recipes
 INNER JOIN categories
 ON categories.id = recipes.category_id;
```

Below is a highlighted version to illustrate where each column is coming from. The JOIN columns are in pink.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/join-query.jpg)

The query result is a new table that has one row for every matching pair of rows across the joined tables. In our example, this means 1 row for each matching pair of rows where`categories.id` is equal to `recipes.category_id`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/join-table.jpg)

This is how the query result looks like in `psql`.

```text
 id |  label  | category_id | id | name
----+---------+-------------+----+-------
  1 | Udon    |           1 |  1 | vegan
  2 | Mee Pok |           2 |  2 | keto
  3 | Pasta   |           1 |  1 | vegan
```

Note how row 1 in the `categories` table is duplicated on multiple rows in this new joined table. This is because there are multiple recipes with `category_id` of 1 in the `recipes` table.

### Rename Output Column Names with Aliases

We can change column names in query results by using SQL's `AS` keyword to avoid clashes in column names in the joined table. Using `AS` does not affect the column name in the original table. Here we rename `category_id` and `id` to `recipe_category_id` and `category_id` respectively for clarity.

```sql
SELECT recipes.id, recipes.label, recipes.category_id AS recipe_category_id, categories.id AS category_id, categories.name
FROM recipes
INNER JOIN categories
ON categories.id = recipes.category_id;
```

```text
 id |  label  | recipe_category_id | category_id | name
----+---------+--------------------+-------------+-------
  1 | Udon    |                  1 |           1 | vegan
  2 | Mee Pok |                  2 |           2 | keto
  3 | Pasta   |                  1 |           1 | vegan
```

### Filter Join Results

Almost all of our `INNER JOIN` queries will have a `WHERE` clause. In the following query we get a list of recipes with the category name for each recipe for all the vegan recipes.

```sql
SELECT recipes.id, recipes.label, recipes.category_id AS recipe_category_id, categories.id AS category_id, categories.name
FROM recipes
INNER JOIN categories
ON categories.id = recipes.category_id
WHERE category_id=1;
```

## Further Reading on Joins

There are 4 main kinds of joins in SQL: Inner Join, Outer Join, Left Outer Join, and Right Outer Join. No need to worry about joins other than Inner Join for now, but if you'd like to understand more, [this](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp) may be a helpful breakdown.
