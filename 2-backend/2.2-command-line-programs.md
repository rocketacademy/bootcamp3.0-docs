# 2.2: Command Line Programs

## Introduction

We will create basic command line programs using Node.js' built-in [`process`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process) global variable.

## `process.argv` is Array of Program Parameters

`process.argv` contains all the information about what was typed into the terminal when the Node.js program was executed. Create an `index.js` file that contains the following.

#### index.js

```javascript
console.log('this is process argv!');
console.log(process.argv);
```

#### Sample Commands

Run `index.js` with various inputs.

```javascript
node index.js
```

```javascript
node index.js tomatoes
```

```javascript
node index.js apples bananas
```

```javascript
node index.js chicken pork beef
```

1. Notice the data type of `process.argv` and how its contents change depending on the command-line parameters.
2. Notice `process.argv[0]` is the absolute path to the Node.js application.
3. Notice `process.argv[1]` is the absolute path to the JavaScript file that Node.js is running.

## `process.argv` Values are Strings

The data type of `process.argv` values is always string.

#### index.js

```javascript
console.log('Process argv values are strings!');
console.log(process.argv[2] + process.argv[3] + process.argv[4]);
```

#### Sample Command

```bash
node index.js 1 1 1 # this will output 111, not 3
```

## Metric Conversion Program

Use `process.argv` to capture input from the user. Since the first two elements of the `process.argv` array will be the Node.js path and the file path, we start looking for user arguments at element 2.

### Convert KM to Miles

#### index.js

```javascript
const distanceInKm = process.argv[2];
const distanceInMiles = Number(distanceInKm) * 0.62;
console.log(distanceInMiles);
```

#### Sample Command

```javascript
node index.js 76
```

### Convert Litres to Gallons

#### Sample Command

```javascript
node index.js 1 // this should output 0.264172
```
