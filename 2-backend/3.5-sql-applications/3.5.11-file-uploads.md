# 3.5.11: File Uploads

## Introduction

In [3.1.3: POST Requests](../3.1-express-js/3.1.3-post-requests.md#receive-post-request-data-as-keys-and-values), we added an `express.urlencoded` middleware to populate `request.body`. For file uploads, we will add a similar configuration to Express using the [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) library to accept binary file data in requests.

## Multer Setup in Express

Multer names and saves uploaded files to a local folder on the server, and adds file metadata to the Express `request` object in a `file` key.

### Install `multer`

```bash
npm install multer
```

### Create File Upload Directory

Create an `uploads` directory in our repo to store files.

```text
mkdir uploads
```

### Add `uploads` to .gitignore

We want Git to save the _existence_ \*\*\*\*of the `uploads` folder, but ignore the files in it because the files in `uploads` are not part of application logic. Ignoring the files in `uploads` also prevents our Git repo from getting unnecessarily large.

**.gitignore**

```text
uploads/*
```

### Initialise \`multer\` in index.js

Specify the `uploads` destination folder when initialising `multer`. See [Multer docs](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) for details.

#### index.js

```javascript
import multer from 'multer';

// set the name of the upload directory here
const multerUpload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });
```

## Update Application Logic to Accept File Uploads

### Update HTML Form to Accept File Data

1. Add `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute to our opening `form` tag. This signals that the form contains file data.
2. Add an `input` tag of type `file` to accept file data in the form.

#### upload.ejs

```markup
<form action="/recipe" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <label for="label">recipe label:</label><br />
  <input type="text" id="label" name="label" /><br />
  <label for="photo">recipe photo:</label><br />
  <input type="file" name="photo" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

### Add Multer Middleware to POST Route

Add `multerUpload.single` middleware to the POST route where we plan to receive the file upload. Provide the file upload form input field's `name` attribute as a parameter to the middleware.

#### index.js

```javascript
app.get('/recipe', (request, response) => {
  response.render('upload');
});

app.post('/recipe', multerUpload.single('photo'), (request, response) => {
  console.log(request.file);
  response.send('worked');
});
```

### Use File Metadata in `request.file`

In production apps we would take the information from `request.file` and save it to the DB. Notice how the file name is a cryptographic hash, and there is no file extension. This is deliberate to ensure file names are unique. If we wish to name files differently Multer accepts [configuration options](https://github.com/expressjs/multer#multeropts) at initialisation.

#### `request.file`

```javascript
{
  fieldname: 'photo',
  originalname: 'hickey.png',
  encoding: '7bit',
  mimetype: 'image/png',
  destination: 'uploads/',
  filename: 'b6c6612935244b080fc2daa81ac1b3b8',
  path: 'uploads/b6c6612935244b080fc2daa81ac1b3b8',
  size: 422224
}
```

## Save File Upload Metadata to DB

In this example we save uploaded file's name to our DB so our app can retrieve the file when it needs to. We save the file name to a column called `photo` in the `recipes` table.

### Create Column to Store File Name

In this example our file name column is `photo`. Please use a more descriptive name depending on your context.

#### init\_tables.sql

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  label TEXT,
  photo TEXT
);
```

### Store File Name in DB from Route Middleware

When processing the request in our route middleware, store the uploaded file's name in a new row in the DB.

#### index.js

```javascript
app.post('/recipe', multerUpload.single('photo'), (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');
  console.log(request.file);

  const sqlQuery = 'INSERT INTO recipes (label, photo) VALUES ($1, $2)';
  // get the photo column value from request.file
  const values = [request.body.label, request.file.filename];

  // Query using pg.Pool instead of pg.Client
  pool.query(sqlQuery, values, (error, result) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log('Error executing query', error.stack);
      response.status(503).send(result.rows);
      return;
    }
    console.log(result.rows[0].name);
    response.send(result.rows);
  });
});
```

## Retrieve Uploaded Files in the App

To retrieve uploaded files, we will reference the uploaded file's location and use it to render the file. In this example because the uploaded file is an image, we will use the file's location to create an `img` tag in our EJS template. When the rendered HTML page loads client-side, it will make a request for the file via the `img` tag, and Express will serve the file.

### Configure Express to Retrieve Static Files from `uploads`

Add `express.static` config to allow Express to serve files from the `uploads` folder. Express supports multiple `express.static` configs so we don't need to worry about conflicts with our other static file folders for files such as CSS.

```javascript
app.use(express.static('uploads'));
```

### Test File Retrieval

To test this, try accessing the file directly from our server.

#### Request Template

Note that `<UPLOADED_FILENAME>` references the Multer-generated filename, not the filename on our local computers.

```javascript
http://localhost:3000/<UPLOADED_FILENAME>
```

#### Sample Request

The file name in this example is from the `request.file` example above.

```javascript
http://localhost:3000/b6c6612935244b080fc2daa81ac1b3b8
```

This should cause Express to send the file back. We should see it as a download.

### Retrieve File Name using SQL in Express

This GET route's logic in `index.js` doesn't need to change. Our SQL query now returns the uploaded file's name because we stored it in the `photo` column in the `recipes` table.

#### index.js

```javascript
app.get('/recipe/:id', (request, response) => {
  const sqlQuery = 'SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE id=$1;';
  const values = [request.params.id];

  // Query using pg.Pool instead of pg.Client
  pool.query(sqlQuery, values, (error, result) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log('Error executing query', error.stack);
      response.status(503).send(result.rows);
      return;
    }
    console.log(result.rows[0].name);
    const data = {
      recipe: result.rows[0],
    };
    response.render('recipe', data);
  });
});
```

### Render File using File Name in EJS

Using the data retrieved from our DB, we render the recipe photo in our EJS template. We use the `photo` attribute of the recipe record to request the photo file in the `uploads` folder. `photo` contains the file name stored in the database.

#### recipe.ejs

```markup
<h3>Recipe Photo:</h3>
<p>
  <img src="/<%= recipe.photo %>" />
</p>
```

## Looking Ahead

In production applications we would rarely store file uploads on the same machine as our web application server \(Express in our case\). This is because our app servers have limited storage space, and storing file uploads for many users would quickly exhaust this space. In practice, file uploads are typically stored with a 3rd-party file hosting service such as AWS S3. We will learn this in a later module, and for now it is ok to store uploaded files locally on the app server.
