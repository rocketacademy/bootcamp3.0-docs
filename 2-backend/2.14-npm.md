# 2.14: NPM

## Introduction

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) \(Node Package Manager\) is the most popular package manager for Node that allows us to incorporate 3rd-party software packages \(aka libraries\) in our apps. We will be using `npm` for the rest of Bootcamp to build more complex apps that rely on 3rd-party packages.

## Setup

Create a folder with an NPM project inside it. `npm init` initialises the NPM project, and the `-y` flag sets our answers to `yes` for all of the setup questions.

```text
mkdir my-first-npm-project
cd my-first-npm-project
npm init -y
```

## `package.json`

`package.json` specifies all configuration for our Node project managed by NPM. It operates similarly to the `.git` folder in our Git repos that configures everything Git-related for each repo.

We should see something like the following when we open the generated `package.json` file in VSCode.

```javascript
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Some Random Stuff.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/rocketacademy/my-repo.git"
  },
  "author": "me",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Installing NPM Packages

NPM allows us to download 3rd-party code packages from the Internet to add functionality to our apps without writing too much code ourselves. The following command downloads and installs a [package to create ASCII cow images](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cows).

```text
npm install cows
```

We can engage with NPM packages in several ways. Typically we discover packages through googling and references from google results like tutorials.

1. We can download packages from the command line with `npm install`.
2. We can visit the [NPM website for that package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cows) to learn how to use it.
3. We can visit the [GitHub repo for that package](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cows) to see its source code.

## Require vs. Import Syntax

So far we've been using `import` syntax to import Node modules. Before Node version 12 the default syntax was `require`, and much documentation online still references the old `require` syntax. 

For RA's Bootcamp there is no practical difference between `import` and `require`, but we will use `import` where we can for consistency. To use `import` with Node.js we will need to add the `"type": "module"` key-value pair to `package.json`.

#### Require Syntax

```javascript
const cows = require('cows');
```

#### Import Syntax

The equivalent statement in import syntax assumes an `export default` from the imported module. There are no named exports with `require` syntax.

```javascript
import cows from 'cows';
```

## NPM Project Dependencies

After running `npm install`, our NPM project will now list the installed package as a "dependency", i.e. a package that our app depends on to run properly. NPM will also have installed all of our package's dependencies, and their dependencies ad infinitum. NPM packages almost always depend on other NPM packages, because nobody builds apps from scratch. For example, [here](https://npmgraph.js.org/?q=eslint) is the dependency graph for the `eslint` NPM package that we have been using since Coding Basics.

3 files will change in our project folder when we run `npm install`.

### `package.json`

After `npm install`, NPM adds a new key in `package.json` called "dependencies" if it doesn't exist already. NPM installs the most recent version of the package as a dependency, and lists the package name and version number in the "dependencies" object in `package.json` so that other copies of this repo can also retrieve the same package version. If we need a specific package version that is not the latest, we can specify it when we run `npm install`. 

```javascript
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Some Random Stuff.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/rocketacademy/my-repo.git"
  },
  "author": "me",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "cows": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```

### `package-lock.json`

After `npm install`, NPM creates a file called `package-lock.json` \(if it doesn't exist already\) that records version numbers of all dependencies of the target package \(and the dependencies of those packages, ad infinitum\), so that if we reproduced this repo on another computer, we would use the same dependency versions. `package-lock.json` is managed by NPM and we should never have to manually edit `package-lock.json` ourselves.

### `node_modules`

After `npm install`, NPM creates a folder called `node_modules` \(if it doesn't exist already\) with the package we installed and all of the packages it depends on. You may notice that there are many more folders in `node_modules` than packages we installed explicitly, because `node_modules` contains a folder for every dependency of every dependency. Similar to `package-lock.json`, `node_modules` is managed by NPM and we should never need to manually modify code within `node_modules`.

### What to Commit to Git

We should always commit both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to Git so that other computers and team members can access the same versions we are using, eliminating bugs due to version mismatches.

We should avoid committing `node_modules` to Git, because `node_modules` can get quite large and everything in `node_modules` can be installed on an Internet-connected machine by running `npm install` in the project root folder where `package.json` is. Committing a large, redundant set of files like `node_modules` will unnecessarily slow down Git operations, especially pushing and pulling from GitHub.

#### .gitignore

You may have noticed a file in RA repos called `.gitignore`, and that this file often has a line that says `node_modules`. This file tells Git which files or folders to ignore when detecting changes. In this case, we have set `.gitignore` to ignore the `node_modules` folder so that we never commit `node_modules` to the repo. Read more about `.gitignore` [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). 

### Development Dependencies

You may have noticed that ESLint dependencies in the Bootcamp Git repos are stored in a section of `package.json` called "devDependencies". dev or development dependencies are dependencies used purely for development purposes, which developers do not want to be included in the application package deployed to end users. The primary reason for this is to reduce the size of the app for faster load times.

To install packages to dev dependencies, add the `-D` flag to `npm install` commands.

## Exercises

1. Follow steps above to initialise a new NPM project and install the `cows` package.
2. Look for the `index.js` file in the `cows` package we installed in `node_modules`. Are you able to understand the code?
