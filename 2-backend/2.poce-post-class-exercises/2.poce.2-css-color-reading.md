# 2.POCE.2: CSS Color Reading

## Setup

Start with the [base Node repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).

## Base

Create a command line program that takes in a CSS file and lists all the colors inside.

styles.css

```css
body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}

p {
  background-color: #000000;
}

span {
  background-color: #000000;
}
```

Run it by passing in the path to the file to read.

```text
node index.js styles.css
```

Outputs:

```text
#ffffff
#000000
#000000
```

## Color Occurence

List how many times a color was mentioned:

```text
#ffffff:1
#000000:2
```

## Comfortable

Try your program on a bigger stylesheet, like bootstrap: [https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.css](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.css)

### RGB

If the stylesheet has RGB colors set, list those under the hex colors:

```css
span {
  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
}
```

```text
#ffffff:1
```

### Styles

List how many times a given style was set.

```text
node index.js styles.css
```

Outputs:

```text
-------
color:
-------
#ffffff:1
#000000:2
-------
styles:
-------
background-color:3
```

### Lint: Semi-colons

Check to make sure there are no missing semi-colons.

## More Comfortable

### Minified

Does your program work on a minified stylesheet? \(This is a CSS file with no newlines\). [https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css)

Look for other versions of the CSS file here: [https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)

### Lint: Curly Braces

Check the file to make sure there are no missing curly braces.

### Full Analysis

Give a complete report of the linting above, and how many times each style and color was used.
