# 2.POCE.2: CSS Reader

## Setup

Start with the [base Node repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).

## Base

### Read CSS Colours

Create a command line program that reads in a CSS file and lists all the colours inside.

#### styles.css

```css
body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}

p {
  background-color: #000000;
}

span {
  background-color: #000000;
}
```

Run the program by passing in the path to the CSS file as a param.

```
node index.js styles.css
```

#### Sample Output

```
#ffffff
#000000
#000000
```

### Output Colour Occurrence Frequency

Without repeating colours, list how many times each colour appeared in the file.

#### Sample Output

```
#ffffff: 1
#000000: 2
```

## Comfortable

### Bigger CSS File

Try your program on a bigger stylesheet, like Bootstrap: [https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.css](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.css)

### Read RGB Colours

If the CSS uses RGB colours, output those RGB colours in hex format along with any other hex colours in the CSS.

#### styles.css

```css
span {
  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
}
```

#### Sample Output

```
#ffffff: 1
```

### Count Style Rule Usage

In addition to colour frequencies, list how many times each CSS style name was used.

#### Sample Output

```
-------
colours:
-------
#ffffff: 1
#000000: 2 
-------
styles:
-------
background-color: 3
```

### Lint Semicolons

Output the lines in the CSS file that are missing semicolons and their respective line numbers.

## More Comfortable

### Minified CSS File

Does your program work on a minified stylesheet, i.e. a CSS file with no newlines? [https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css)

If helpful, find other versions of the same CSS file here: [https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com).

### Lint Curly Braces

Output the lines in the CSS file that are missing curly braces and their respective line numbers.

### Full Analysis

Give a complete report of the linting above, and how many times each style and colour was used.
