# 3.POCE.8: Bird Watching Behaviour

## Introduction

Add a many-to-many relationship between notes and bird behaviours to Bird Watcher. Please read [3.5.6: Forms for Many-to-Many Relationships](../3.4-sql-applications/3.4.6-forms-for-many-to-many-relationships.md) before working on this exercise.

## Base

Allow the user to add bird behaviours to notes when creating new notes. Seed the database with a few categories based on the below Bird Behaviour Bingo image such as bathing, resting and pecking. A note can have more than one behaviour associated with it, and vice versa. Do not create any new routes for this functionality.

Do not create any new routes for this functionality.

## Comfortable

Create GET routes to retrieve behaviour data and notes on birds with specific behaviours.

#### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /behaviours | GET | Render a list of behaviours |
| /behaviours/:id | GET | Render a behaviour. This has a list of all notes with this behaviour. |

## More Comfortable

Allow editing of behaviours in notes. This means when we render note pages, we render checkboxes that are checked according to the current values in the DB.
