# 2.POCE.6: To-Do List - JSON DB

## Introduction

Create a command line to-do list app using helper functions from our `jsonFileStorage` module and a local JSON file `data.json` as our database.

## Base

1. Clone the [terminal-todo repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/terminal-todo-bootcamp).
2. Initialise `data.json` with the following contents.

   ```javascript
   {
     "items": []
   }
   ```

3. Build the to-do app to support `show` and `add` commands as described below.

### Show Items

Show all to-do items in the list. 

#### Sample Command

```text
node index.js show
```

#### Sample Output

```text
- wash the car
- cook dinner
- buy bananas
```

### Add Item

Add an item to the list.

#### Sample Command

```text
node index.js add "send flowers"
```

#### Sample Output

```text
I have added "send flowers" to your to-do list.
```

## Comfortable

### Complete Item

1. Update the app to support a `complete` command that marks a to-do item complete.
   1. The user should be able to specify the number of a given to-do item to mark it as complete.
2. Update the output of the `show` command to be a numbered list, and to have a `Done` section below with all the completed to-dos.
   1. The number of each to-do can correspond to its index in the to-do array.

#### Sample Show Command Output

```text
To-Do:
1. wash the car
2. cook dinner
3. buy bananas

Done:
```

#### Sample Command

```text
node index.js complete 2
```

#### Sample Complete Command Output

```text
I have marked item 2, "cook dinner" as complete.
```

#### Sample Subsequent Show Command Output

```text
To-Do:
1. wash the car
2. buy bananas

Done:
1. cook dinner
```

## More Comfortable

### Add `remove` and `editOneElement` to `jsonFileStorage`

1. Add `remove` and `editOneElement` functions to `jsonFileStorage` to support removing and editing existing to-do items \(and array elements in general for other apps\).
2. The following are sample ways to design the functions in `jsonFileStorage`.

```javascript
/**
 * Remove an element from an array in JSON
 * @param {string} filename
 * @param {string} key - The name of the key of the array we wish to edit
 * @param {number} index - The index of the array we wish to delete from
 * @param {function} callback - The callback function to call after removing
 * @returns undefined
 */
remove(
  'data.json',
  'items',
  2,
  (dataWithoutItem) => {
    // ...
  }
);

/**
 * Edit the properties of an element in an array in JSON
 * @param {string} filename
 * @param {string} key - The name of the key of the array we wish to edit
 * @param {number} index - The index of the array we wish to edit
 * @param {object} payload - The attributes we wish to add to the element
 * @param {function} callback - The callback function to call after editing
 * @returns undefined
 */
editOneElement(
  'data.json',
  'items',
  2,
  { text: 'buy soap and toothpaste' },
  (dataWithEditedItem) => {
    // ...
  }
);
```

### Remove Item

Remove the item that corresponds to the given number.

#### Sample Show Command Output

```text
To-Do:
1. wash the car
2. cook dinner
3. buy bananas

Done:
```

#### Sample Remove Command

```text
node index.js remove 2
```

#### Sample Remove Command Output

```text
I have removed Item 2, "cook dinner".
```

#### Sample Subsequent Show Command Output

```text
To-Do:
1. wash the car
2. buy bananas

Done:
```

### Edit Item

Update the text of the given item.

#### Sample Show Command Output

```text
To-Do:
1. wash the car
2. cook dinner
3. buy bananas

Done:
```

#### Sample Edit Command

```text
node index.js edit 2 "cook supper"
```

#### Sample Edit Command Output

```text
I have edited Item 2, "cook dinner" to be "cook supper".
```

#### Sample Subsequent Show Command Output

```text
To-Do:
1. wash the car
2. cook supper
3. buy bananas

Done:
```

### Created and Completed Dates

1. Add dates to the DB to track when each item was added and completed.
2. Use the [JavaScript Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).
3. Show date values in `show` command output.
