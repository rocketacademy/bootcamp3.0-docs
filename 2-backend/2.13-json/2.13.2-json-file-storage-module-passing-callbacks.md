# 2.13.2: JSON File Storage Module - Passing Callbacks

## Introduction

Currently the logic that runs after a file is read into memory is hard-coded in `jsonFileStorage`, e.g. in the `add` function. This is not ideal because we would need to create a new function that repeats file reading and writing code for each type of file edit operation, like we did in [2.ICE.5: Reading and Writing to JSON](../2.ice-in-class-exercises/2.ice.5-json-cards.md#limitations-with-current-jsonfilestorage-module). A more elegant solution would be to pass custom edit operation logic into `jsonFileStorage` so that `jsonFileStorage` can continue to be generic, and we can re-use it across apps without repeating code.

## Temperature App

1. Let's build an app that records a list of temperatures in a JSON file and provides the average of recorded temperatures on-demand.
2. We'll upgrade `jsonFileStorage` such that our app can pass custom logic to it, and we can re-use the same `jsonFileStorage` code later for other apps.

### Database Format

The format of our JSON file `data.json` might look like the following.

```javascript
{
  "temperatures": [23, 32, 43, 12]
}
```

### List Temperatures

We could use our existing `read` function from `jsonFileStorage` to read temperatures from our DB.

```javascript
import { read } from 'jsonFileStorage.js';

// Print all temperatures in data.json
read('data.json');
```

### Get Average Temperature

There is no code in `jsonFileStorage` that allows us to retrieve data elegantly from our JSON DB and operate on it. If we were to write this code from scratch, it might look like the following.

#### index.js

```javascript
const handleFileRead = (readErr, jsonContentStr) => {
  if (readErr) {
    console.log('Reading error', readErr);
  }

  // Convert JSON content from string to object
  const jsonContentObj = JSON.parse(jsonContentStr);
  
  // Extract temperatures variable from JSON for readability
  const temperatures = jsonContentObj.temperatures;

  // Calculate average temperature
  let totalTemp = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i += 1) {
    totalTemp += temperatures[i];
  }
  const avgTemp = totalTemp / temperatures.length;

  // Log average temperature
  console.log(avgTemp);
};

// Read JSON DB and operate on its data
readFile('data.json', 'utf-8', handleFileRead);
```

This is similar to the pattern we suggested in [2.ICE.5: Reading and Writing to JSON](../2.ice-in-class-exercises/2.ice.5-json-cards.md#limitations-with-current-jsonfilestorage-module), which is not ideal because it requires us to repeat boilerplate reading and potentially writing code. Let's see how we can modify `jsonFileStorage` to handle the boilerplate logic, while accepting custom logic from client applications.

## Passing Callbacks to `jsonFileStorage`

We could move `handleFileRead` into `index.js` and pass it as a parameter to `read`. The code would look like the following.

#### index.js

```javascript
import { read } from 'jsonFileStorage.js';

// The client application defines custom logic, while jsonFileStorage handles
// boilerplate reading and writing logic
const handleFileRead = (readErr, jsonContentStr) => {
  // Same code as above
};

read('data.json', handleFileRead);
```

#### jsonFileStorage.js

```javascript
import { readFile } from 'fs';

// The client application provides the handleFileRead callback.
// This increases customisability of the jsonFileStorage module.
export function read(filename, handleFileRead) {
  readFile(filename, 'utf-8', handleFileRead);
}
```

## Further Reducing Repeated Code

The above architecture is ok, but requires us to repeat logic like `JSON.parse` in every `handleFileRead` callback we write. Let's move the standard `JSON.parse` code into `jsonFileStorage` such that the callback we pass to `jsonFileStorage` only contains the custom logic and no boilerplate logic.

#### index.js

We create a function `handleJsonRead` that receives the JS Object of the JSON file's contents.

```javascript
import { read } from 'jsonFileStorage.js';

const handleJsonRead = (jsonContentObj) => {
  // Same code as above to calculate and log average temperature.
};

read('data.json', handleJsonRead);
```

#### jsonFileStorage.js

We now keep the `handleFileRead` callback inside of `read`, but `handleFileRead` calls the client callback `handleJsonRead` when it has successfully read the file, checked for errors, and parsed file content into a JS Object. This way we can avoid repeating error checking and string parsing in client code.

```javascript
import { readFile } from 'fs';

/**
 * Read target file, convert contents to Object, call client callback
 * @param {string} filename - JSON DB file name
 * @param {function} handleJsonRead - Callback for successful file read
 *                                    Takes 1 param, JSON content as JS Object
 */
export function read(filename, handleJsonRead) {

  const handleFileRead = (readErr, jsonContentStr) => {  
    // Catch read error if any
    if (readErr) {
      console.error('Read error', readErr);
    }

    // Parse JSON content str into JS Object
    const jsonContentObj = JSON.parse(jsonContentStr);

    // Call custom logic that our app passed into this module
    handleJsonRead(jsonContentObj);
  };

  readFile(filename, 'utf-8', handleFileRead);
}
```

## Exercise

1. Try out each version of the code.
2. In the final code version, add `console.log` to the beginning of each block and before and after each function call in both files to observe the control flow.

## Next Steps

We will summarise the above logic and apply it to `write` and `add` functions in the next module. Our `jsonFileStorage` module will then be able to handle most JSON file operations and be reusable across apps.
