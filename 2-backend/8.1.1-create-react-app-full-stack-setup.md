# 8.1.1: Create React App Full Stack Setup

We will now setup the previous ecommerce full-stack React app in the new Create React App architecture.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cra-arch-2.jpg)

As described before, we will be using 2 completely different repositories to hold the front-end and the back-end of the app.

1. The React app is deployed/started. The Webpack build process is triggered. The resulting files are put into the `/dist` directory, or in development mode, held in the Webpack dev server memory.
2. We type the React app location into the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. The Create React App file server serves the HTML file and the React app JavaScript to the browser. The React app is initialized in the browser.
4. Clicking the "Get Items" button causes an AJAX request to be created inside the React app to: [http://localhost:3004/items](http://localhost:3004/items)
5. The request is received at the Express.js server. The app looks in the database for all items and sends back a JSON response.
6. The JSON data is received and processed by the React app. React manipulates the DOM to show the list of items on screen.

## Back-End

The example back-end repo is here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp)

Note that this is the same exact repo as this: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-bootcamp) from the end of module 4, except for CORS (discussed below).

Run the backend app:

```
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp.git
cd cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp
npm install
npx sequelize db:create
npx sequelize db:migrate
npx sequelize db:seed:all
node index.mjs
```

Test the app by visiting the route for items: [http://localhost:3004/items](http://localhost:3004/items)

## Front-End

The example front end repo is here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp)

Clone and run the front-end app:

```
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp.git
cd cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp
npm start
```

Note that in order to reach the back-end we had to add a complete hard-coded URL: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L10](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L10)

```
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:3002';
```

We would have to change this hard coded value when we wanted to deploy this app to Heroku. In production this value would be replaced by a value set in an environment variable.

When we make the AJAX request for the list of items we use the variable to construct a complete URL: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.js#L31](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L31-L34)

```
axios.get(BACKEND_URL+'/items')
```

## CORS

Besides splitting the code of the app into two repos there is only one other major change in how this code works. The [Express.js CORS middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) has been added as a dependency. We use it as middleware in `index.mjs`.

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L10](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L10)

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  credentials:true,
  origin: FRONTEND_URL
}));
```

CORS is a security feature of modern browsers that disallows AJAX requests to a domain that is different from the originating domain. This is to prevent attackers from pretending to be a legit client and stealing data from our backend servers.

In our case, our requests originate from localhost:3000 and we want to request data from our backend server at localhost:3004. These are different "origins", thus our browsers will disallow these requests by default. To enable such requests, we will need to enable CORS settings server-side. This will let browsers know that the target server allows such cross-origin requests, such that browsers allow such requests to be sent.

CORS security has both client-side and server-side components. The server controls which domains to whitelist. The client first checks its whitelist status with the target server using a "pre-flight request" before sending the actual request from the user application. If the pre-flight request fails due to CORS, the client browser will prevent the actual request from sending, citing CORS as the reason.

#### CORS with cookies

CORS also has to have special instructions to \*send\* cookies from the front end to the back end.

We set this here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L7](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L7)

```javascript
const FRONTEND_URL = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

And here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L13-L14](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L13-L14)

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  credentials:true,
  origin: FRONTEND_URL
}));
```

#### Front End

We tell the backend about the existence of the front end (specifying the URL) and on the frontend here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L6](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L6) where we tell `axios` to send cookies to a non-origin domain. This code needs to be set in each file where axios is imported.

```javascript
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

## Deployment

Create React App deployment works slightly differently from regular Heroku development in [3.8.1: Heroku Deploy](../../3-backend-applications/3.6-heroku/3.6.1-heroku-deploy.md). Please follow the Heroku Deployment instructions in CRA Docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#heroku) to deploy CRA apps.

## Exercise

Follow the above instructions to get the app working.
