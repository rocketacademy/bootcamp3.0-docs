# 3.POCE.6: Bird Watching Users

## Base

Begin by making a branch `3-pce-5` to record the state of your code in the [Bird Watching repo from 3.PCE.5](https://github.com/rocketacademy/birding-express-bootcamp). Start 3.PCE.6 by modifying the `main` branch after saving your previous code in the `3-pce-5` branch.

### User Login and Auth Cookie

Implement the basic user login described in [3.6.2: User Auth](../3.5-authentication/3.5.2-user-auth.md).

When the user logs in, also set their user ID in a cookie.

```sql
response.cookie('userId', user.id);
```

#### Create Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT, password TEXT);
```

#### Routes Reference

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /signup | GET | Render a form that will sign up a user. |
| /signup | POST | Accept a POST request to create a user. |
| /login | GET | Render a form that will log a user in. |
| /login | POST | Accept a POST request to log a user in. |
| /logout | DELETE | Log a user out. Get rid of their cookie. |

### User Notes

Alter the `notes` table so that a note is created by a logged-in user. When we accept a POST request to create a note use the user ID in the request cookie to associate the new note with the logged-in user.

#### Routes Reference

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /note | POST | Accept a POST request to create a new sighting. |

## Comfortable

### User Name in Notes List

List the user name as part of the list of notes.

### User Pages

Use EJS templates to create a unique page for each user with a list of all of that user's notes.

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /users/:id | GET | A list of all notes made by this user. |

## More Comfortable

### Note Editing with Permissions

Implement editing and only allow the owner of the note to edit or delete it.
