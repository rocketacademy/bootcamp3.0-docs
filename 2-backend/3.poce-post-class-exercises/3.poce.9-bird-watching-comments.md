# 3.POCE.9: Bird Watching Comments

## Introduction

Add commenting functionality to Bird Watcher notes. Any user can log into the app and leave comments on any user's notes.

## Base

### Comment Feed

On each note page create a list of all comments for that note.

### Comment Composer

On each note page render a form to create new comments. Use a URL path parameter \(`:id` in the route below\) to pass the comment's note's ID to the server on form submission. Use the login-user's ID set in a cookie to set the comment's user's ID.

### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /note/:id | GET | Render a single note |
| /note/:id/comment | POST | Create a new comment on a given note. |

## Comfortable

### Include Comments in User Activity Feed

On the user's page, in addition to the list of all notes by that user, add a list of comments they've made.

### Routes

| Method | Purpose |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /users/:id | GET | A list of all notes and a list of all comments by this user. |
