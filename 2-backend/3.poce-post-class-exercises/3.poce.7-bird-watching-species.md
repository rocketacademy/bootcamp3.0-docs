# 3.POCE.7: Bird Watching Species

## Introduction

Add species classifications to the bird watching app.

## Base

Refactor the Bird Watcher app so that when a user creates a note they can [select from a list](../3.4-sql-applications/3.4.5-forms-for-one-to-many-relationships.md) which species of bird they have observed. You will need material from [3.5.5: Rendering One-To-Many Forms](../3.4-sql-applications/3.4.5-forms-for-one-to-many-relationships.md) to do this.

### Species Table

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| name | TEXT | Name of species | Northern Pintail |
| scientific\_name | TEXT | Scientific name of species | Anas acuta |

### Species Seed Data

Here are some species we can add to the DB to start.

## Comfortable

Create CRUD routes for maintaining species data in the Bird Watcher app.

#### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /species | GET | Render a form that will create a new species |
| /species | POST | Accept a POST request to create a new species |
| /species/:index | GET | Render a single species. This has a list of all notes with this species. |
| /species/all | GET | Render a list of species in addition to the previous data rendered on the root route. |
| /species/:index/edit | GET | Render a form to edit a species |
| /species/:index/edit | PUT | Accept a request to edit a single species |
| /species/:index/delete | DELETE | Accept a request to delete a species |
