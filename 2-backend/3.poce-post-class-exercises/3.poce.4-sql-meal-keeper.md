# 3.POCE.4: SQL Meal Tracker

## Base

Create a command line app that will keep track of meals that you've eaten.

### Create Table

Write a CREATE TABLE statement based on information below and run it on your database.

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | id | 1 |
| type | TEXT | The type of meal that was eaten. | breakfast, lunch, dinner |
| description | TEXT | Description of what was eaten. | McDonalds and KFC |
| amount\_of_\__alcohol | INTEGER | Unit amount of alcohol consumed with meal. | 3 |
| was\_hungry_\__before\_eating | BOOLEAN | Was feeling hungry before eating or not. | true, false |

### Enter a Meal

Create functionality for the user to log a meal using the command line, where the meal gets saved to the DB.

Feel free to customise your edit command format. The format in the below command is:

`node index.js log <TYPE> <DESCRIPTION> <AMOUNT_OF_ALCOHOL> <WAS_HUNGRY_BEFORE_EATING>`

```text
node index.js log breakfast 'nasi lemak' 0 true
```

### See Meals So Far

Create functionality for the user to see all of their past meals using the command line, where meals are read from the DB.

```text
node index.js report
```

## Comfortable

### Update

When the report prints out the user's meals, allow the user to edit a meal.

#### Report Command

```text
node index.js report
```

#### Sample Report Output

Feel free to customise your report output format.

```text
1 breakfast - nasi lemak - no alcohol - feeling hungry
2 lunch - burrito - 1 unit of alcohol - feeling hungry
```

#### Sample Edit Command

Feel free to customise your edit command format. The format in the below command is:

`node index.js edit <MEAL_ID> <COLUMN_NAME> <COLUMN_VALUE>`

```text
node index.js edit 1 type supper
```

### Report

Allow the user to make more fine-grained reports, for example only reporting meals with specific attributes.

```text
node index.js report breakfast
```

```text
node index.js report hungry
```

```text
node index.js report not-hungry
```

## More Comfortable

### created\_at

Look up the Postgres Date type in the [docs](https://node-postgres.com/features/types#date--timestamp--timestamptz). Change the table to add another column called `created_at`.

### Reports

Add some more detailed reports.

```text
node index.js report drink
```

Give statistics on how often \(as a ratio\) the user consumes alcohol at meal time.

Give statistics on what the average amount of alcohol per meal is.

Do these calculations in JavaScript.

Using the `created_at` column, get a list of all meals since the week began.

```text
node index.js report week-so-far
```

Using the `created_at` column, get a list of the meals in the past seven days not including today.

```text
node index.js report past-week
```

### Deploy

Deploy the app into a new instance of EC2. \(You will have to install Postgres on the instance\). Use your meal tracker remotely via SSH from your local computer.

### Access App via SSH on Mobile

Download an [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-ssh-client/id549039908) or [Android](https://termux.com/) app to access your meal tracker via SSH on mobile.
