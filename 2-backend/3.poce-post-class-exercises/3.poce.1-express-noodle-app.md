# 3.POCE.1: Express Noodle App

## Introduction

Create a noodle recipe app using Express and recipe data provided by RA.

## Setup

1. For and clone [RA's Noodles Express repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/noodles-express-bootcamp). 
2. Express is already listed as a project dependency in `package.json`. After we fork and clone the repo, run `npm i` to install Express.
3. Find RA's list of recipes in `data.json` in the repo.

## Base

### Get Recipe by Index

1. Create the following route in Express.

   ```text
   /recipe/:index
   ```

2. Create a request handler that responds to the above route with a JS object with the relevant recipe data.
   1. For example, a request to the following URL...

      ```text
      http://localhost:3004/recipe/0
      ```

   2. ... sends back the following data.

      ```javascript
      {
        "source": "BBC Good Food",
        "label": "Udon noodle soup",
        "url": "http://www.edamam.com/recipe/udon-noodle-soup-bf283c727cd11fb8ce42b98f09dabbac/noodle",
        "ingredients": "1 vegetable stock cube\n50ml teriyaki sauce\n1 tbsp vegetable oil\n140g chestnut mushroom, sliced\nÂ½ bunch spring onions, thinly sliced\n140g udon noodle\n200g bag spinach",
        "yield": 4,
        "caution": "Sulfites",
        "image": "https://www.edamam.com/web-img/7b2/7b24a14c8756cc1db75eb216fb593e6d.jpg",
        "category": "Vegan"
      }
      ```

### Server Error Checking

1. According to HTTP protocol, if a page or resource is not found, the server should respond with status code 404.
2. Detect when the `index` URL param references an invalid index. When it does, respond with the 404 status code and a relevant message.
3. We can set the status code and send the response in 1 line like the following.

   ```javascript
   res.status(404).send('Sorry, we cannot find that!');
   ```

## Comfortable

### Get Recipes by Yield

Yield refers to the number of portions a given recipe creates.

1. Create a route that responds with a list of recipes that match the yield number.
2. For example, the following URL would return a list of recipes that yield 1 portion.

   ```text
   http://localhost:3004/yield/1
   ```

## More Comfortable

### Get Recipe by Label

1. For SEO reasons we may want a route that has the label of the recipe in it. Create such a route that returns the recipe that matches that label.

   ```text
   http://localhost:3004/recipe-label/udon-noodle-soup
   ```

2. Note if the label has multiple words, it is represented in the URL path with lowercase kebab-case.
