# 3.ICE.5: One to Many

## Introduction

Create a command line app that tracks cats and owners. This exercise will be similar to the command line app in [3.POCE.4: SQL Meal Tracker](../3.poce-post-class-exercises/3.poce.4-sql-meal-keeper.md).

## Base

### DB Setup

1. Create a new database called `cat_owners`.
2. Create the following 2 tables. Record the `CREATE TABLE` statements in a file `init_tables.sql` for debugging purposes.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use psql to run all the SQL in a file, use the following command: `psql -f <PATH_TO_FILE>`
{% endhint %}

#### Owners Table (`owners`)

| column name | data type          | description       | example |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------- |
| id          | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID                | 1       |
| name        | TEXT               | Name of the owner | Kai     |

#### Cats Table (`cats`)

| column name | data type          | description     | example   |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------- |
| id          | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID              | 1         |
| name        | TEXT               | Name of the cat | Kong Ming |
| owner\_id   | INTEGER            | ID of the owner | 1         |

`SERIAL` is "the same as integer except that PostgreSQL will automatically generate and populate values into the `SERIAL` column." - [postgresqltutorial.com](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-data-types/#:\~:text=Integer%20%28%20INT%20%29%20is%20a%204,or%20AUTOINCREMENT%20column%20in%20SQLite.)

`owner_id` is a reference to the `id` column in the `owners` table. This is to represent in SQL the relationship where owners can have many cats and each cat belongs to a single owner.

### Application Setup

1. Begin with the [base Node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp)
2. Install the `pg` library with NPM.
3. Use the code from [3.4.2: PostgreSQL Node App](../3.4-sql-applications/3.4.2-postgresql-node-app.md#select) as a template for `index.js`. Reminder to update `pgConnectionConfigs` to reference the new DB name.

### Create Owner

Create a new entry in the `owners` table.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js create-owner Jim
```

#### Query Template

```
node index.js create-owner <OWNER_NAME>
```

### Create Cat and Associate Cat with Owner

This means that the `owner_id` column in the `cats` table corresponds to the `id` of the relevant owner's row in the `owners` table.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js create-cat 1 Fluffy
```

#### Query Template

```
node index.js create-cat <OWNER_ID> <CAT_NAME>
```

### Get List of Cats and Respective Owners

For the following 2 features you will have to use nested SQL queries. Refer to [3.4.3: Nested SQL Queries](../3.4-sql-applications/3.4.3-nested-sql-queries.md) for examples. Feel free to output the data in any readable format.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js cats
```

#### Example Output

```
Cats:
1. Fluffy: Owner: Jim
2. Cathy: Owner: Jim
```

### Get List of Owners and Respective Cats

#### Example Query

```
node index.js owners
```

#### Example Output

```
Owners:
1. Jim
    - Cats:
        - Fluffy
        - Furr Furr
2. Cathy
    - Cats:
        - Gordon
        - Susan Chan
```

## Comfortable

### Use Owner's Name to Associate Cat with Owner

Specify the owner when creating a cat by using the owner's name instead of the owner's ID.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js create-cat Jim Gordon
```

#### Query Template

```
node index.js create-cat <OWNER_NAME> <CAT_NAME>
```

## More Comfortable

Perform analytics on the data in our DB. For some of these you can simply do calculations in JavaScript instead of writing SQL. You should not need any SQL queries we did not already cover.

### Get Owners with Specific Number of Cats

Add an optional argument to the `owners` feature. Get all the owners with `NUM_CATS_OWNED` cats.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js owners 3
```

#### Query Template

```
node index.js owners <NUM_CATS_OWNED>
```

### Get Owners with Range of Numbers of Cats

Get all the owners with more than `NUM_CATS_OWNED` cats.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js owners '>3'
```

#### Query Template

```
node index.js owners '><NUM_CATS_OWNED>'
```

Get all the owners with less than `NUM_CATS_OWNED` cats.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js owners '<3'
```

#### Query Template

```
node index.js owners '<<NUM_CATS_OWNED>'
```

### Get Other Cats Owned by Given Cat's Owner

Get all cats that Fluffy's owner owns.

#### Example Query

```
node index.js other-cats Fluffy
```

#### Query Template

```
node index.js other-cats <CAT_NAME>
```
