# 3.1.2: HTML Forms

## Introduction

HTML forms generate requests to send data to servers. We could manually create these requests with relevant data without forms, but forms make our lives easier.

## Default GET Request Forms

1.  Render the following HTML and click Submit.

    ```markup
    <form action="/hello">
      <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
      <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
      <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
      <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form> 
    ```
2. The form action is the destination URL path to send a request to on form submit. Given a relative path like `/hello`, the default destination server is the one that returned the HTML containing the form.
3. Unless otherwise specified, forms send GET requests. GET requests will send all form input in URL query parameters that are part of the request URL.
4. The Chrome Network tab will show the request query parameters in the Headers sub-tab for a given request.

## POST Request Forms

1. We will use forms to create data on our servers that persists on disk until explicitly deleted.
2.  POST is the HTTP method that communicates a request to create new data in the database. We can set the method of a form with the `method` attribute. POST requests send form data as part of the HTTP request body.

    ```markup
    <form action="/hello" method="POST">
    ```
3. We will persist data in a JSON file for now. We will soon learn the SQL database language and relevant frameworks, but the data storing logic in our code will remain similar. Many popular NoSQL SQL-alternative databases (e.g. Mongo, Firebase) continue to use JSON-like storage formats.
4. Update our form to send POST requests and observe the differences in the generated request in Chrome.
   1. The "Query String Parameters" header for our request has changed to "Form Data".
   2. There are also no more query parameters in the URL we now sent a POST instead of GET request.
   3. The `name` attributes in the `input` HTML tags are keys in the form data. The values are the relevant input data.

#### Refreshing Form Submit Page

1. By default, if we refresh the page in Chrome after submitting a form, Chrome will replay the request and submit the form again.
2. This is why many apps ask us not to refresh the page on sensitive post-submit pages such as for payments.
3. To avoid this behaviour our apps can redirect to a new page after form submit.
