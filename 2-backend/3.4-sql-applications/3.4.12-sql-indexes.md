# 3.4.12: SQL Indexes

## Introduction

SQL indexes are used to speed up queries on large SQL databases. DB admins can create indexes on specific columns or sets of columns in relevant tables to speed up queries that utilise those columns. 

SQL indexes are a common trivia question in coding interviews, e.g. "how would you speed up performance of a SQL database?". Indexes are not always the right solution because they take up space, but they are an important tool in the database toolkit, not to mention for coding interviews.
