# 3.4.8: SQL Clients

## Introduction

We may have found that using `psql` to monitor DB changes can be tedious, because we need to run a query with raw SQL each time we wish to check our data. 

SQL clients provide graphical user interfaces for us to monitor our data with clicks instead of typing queries. The SQL clients translate our clicks into queries under the hood, and typically we can also customise those queries if we need to.

There are many SQL clients to choose from, but RA recommends [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for Windows and [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) for Mac, both of which are free.

## Windows

From the instructions here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45707319/pgadmin-on-windows-10-with-postgres-when-installed-via-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45707319/pgadmin-on-windows-10-with-postgres-when-installed-via-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows)

## Alternatives

If we prefer a different interface we can try other Postgres SQL clients. They generally behave the same but with different user interfaces.
