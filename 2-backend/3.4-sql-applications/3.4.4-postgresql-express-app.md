# 3.4.4: PostgreSQL Express App

## Introduction

For Express we'll use a `pg` class other than `Client`. Unlike Node CLI programs that run and exit immediately, Express apps run and listen for requests until stopped. We need a way to manage the database connections that Express makes and end those connections appropriately. `pg`'s `Pool` class does this automatically, and enables us to accept multiple requests simultaneously. The word pool refers to an available "pool" of connections. We can think of it as a managed array of connection metadata.

## Setup

Remember to install `pg`.

```text
npm install pg
```

## Sample Code

**index.js**

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import pg from 'pg';

// Initialise DB connection
const { Pool } = pg;
const pgConnectionConfigs = {
  user: '<MY_UNIX_USERNAME>',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: '<MY_UNIX_USERNAME>',
  port: 5432, // Postgres server always runs on this port by default
};
const pool = new Pool(pgConnectionConfigs);

const app = express();

app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');

  const whenDoneWithQuery = (error, result) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log('Error executing query', error.stack);
      response.status(503).send(result.rows);
      return;
    }
    console.log(result.rows[0].name);
    response.send(result.rows);
  };

  // Query using pg.Pool instead of pg.Client
  pool.query('SELECT * from cats', whenDoneWithQuery);
});

app.listen(3004);
```

Note: There is no need to run `pool.end` like how we ran `client.end` with the `pg` `Client` class in our Node CLI apps. This is because in server applications we expect the DB connection to persist beyond individual requests.
