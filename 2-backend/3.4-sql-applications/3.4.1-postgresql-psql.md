# 3.4.1: PostgreSQL, psql

## Intro to Database Servers

Database servers run applications that allow programs to manipulate the data inside them. In this module we'll learn how to create, manage, and deploy database servers. Note that this is separate from managing the _data_ inside the database, which is done by the SQL language. How SQL interacts with the database server hard drive depends on the particular SQL implementation.

Part of setting up a database is setting up database schema, i.e. what tables and columns are in the database. We'll learn more about how to design database schema in [3.4.6: SQL Schema Design](../3.3-sql-language/3.3.6-sql-schema-design.md), but for now RA will provide database schema that we will implement. Web applications typically do not manipulate database schema in response to user actions; application code depends on database schema, but the schema is not defined by the application.

![The data in the database is stored separately from the application code.](../../.gitbook/assets/sql-database.jpg)

Unlike with the `data.json` file we used prior to SQL, the data inside our database will _not_ be part of the application repo. Database servers are often on separate machines from web application servers, such that they can be accessed by multiple applications. We will see this in Module 4 when we use Heroku, but for now, we will keep our database server on the same machine as our Express app.

![The PostgreSQL server is typically on a separate machine from the web applications that access it.](../../.gitbook/assets/postgres.jpg)

Managing the database server application, e.g. ports, backups, version upgrades, is typically considered developer operations or DevOps and can be a separate role from application development.

## Intro to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL (or Postgres for short) is the database application server that we will be using. Other popular SQL implementations are MySQL and SQLite, but PostgreSQL is a good generalist implementation with a good balance of lightweight and feature-rich.

Postgres implements the SQL language in order to store and retrieve data from a set of files on the hard drive.

Postgres is a server application that uses it's own TCP/IP protocol, usually on port 5432 (although this is configurable). Requests are sent to the server that contain the SQL language queries for the server to process. The result of the queries is sent back to the client.

Postgres is a software implementation of a database system. So far we've only dealt with a database at a conceptual level, and using that database though SQL.

However, a database system is the actual implementation of something that runs SQL and keeps the data. Each system implements the SQL language slightly differently, keeps the data on the disk in a slightly different way, and gets the data back out differently.

The database system ensures fundamental database properties like [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability). A database system needs to account for circumstances like when two opposing queries happen at the same time, or like when a long running INSERT query fails while executing, due to something like power failure. The system doesn't solve these problems, but it is guaranteed to behave in a consistent manner each time.

A database system also build functionality for things like automatic backup of the data to another computer, and things for speeding up queries like column indexes.

## psql and psql Setup

Psql is the Postgres command-line client to access our databases. To help us learn SQL we will use `psql` to manipulate our databases with SQL commands. In later modules we will use a SQL client that allows us to manipulate our databases using a GUI. 

### Mac

Install [postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com). Open the application and follow the setup instructions at [postgresapp.com](https://postgresapp.com).

### Ubuntu (for Windows users in WSL and EC2 Installation)

Install Postgres

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install postgresql
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

Set the Postgres server to start in the background:

```
sudo service postgresql start
```

Set password-less login by opening pg_hba.conf and copying the below contents into it.

```
sudo chmod 777 /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
```

```bash
# "sudo" runs the command as the root user
# "$(which code)" gets the location of the VSCode application locally

sudo "$(which code)" /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
```

If the above command doesn't work, try running VSCode without `sudo`.

```bash
# Open pg_hba.conf in VSCode

code /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
```

The above will open a new VSCode window.

`pg_hba.conf` contents to copy: (replace the whole file contents with the lines below)

```
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# IPv4 local connections:
local    all            all                                     trust
host     all            all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host     all            all             ::1/128                 trust
```

Restart Postgres to get the new configs:

```
sudo service postgresql restart
```

Login as the user `postgres` - the default root user for the Postgres database. This system user was created when you installed Postgres.

```
sudo su - postgres
```

Create a user and database named after your Ubuntu user. We can retrieve our Ubuntu username via the `whoami` command on the command line.

Use the Postgres `createuser` command to create a new Postgres database user that is named the same as your current user.

```
createuser -s <MY_UNIX_USERNAME>
```

Create a default Postgres database named after your current user. We will use DBs named after our usernames to test SQL syntax. Once we start building applications with SQL, we will name our DBs after our applications.

```
createdb <MY_UNIX_USERNAME>
```

Exit out of the `postgres` user

```
exit
```

Test it:

```
psql
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To connect to a specific database, enter the database name as a parameter after `psql`, e.g. `psql <DATABASE_NAME>`.
{% endhint %}

Reference reading: [https://linuxhint.com/installpostgresql\\-ubuntu/](https://linuxhint.com/install_postgresql\_-ubuntu/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
On Ubuntu, when you restart your computer you may have to start the Postgres server with the following command.

```
sudo service postgresql start
```

On Mac you should be able to start Postgres by opening the Postgres app.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To quit out of `psql`, use the command `\q`. For more `psql` commands, see the psql cheatsheet [here](https://gist.github.com/awongh/f15415716d538a68a7ac5f4ad28dfe3c).
{% endhint %}

## Exercises

Create a table and make SQL commands.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The CREATE TABLE is different from the SQL query in 3.4.1. This is because some SQL syntax is different in Postgres from SQLite.
{% endhint %}

### CREATE DATABASE

Run this on the command line (outside of `psql`). A rule of thumb is to create a new database instance per app. This is to ensure we do not mix data between apps and corrupt our databases. For now we will use DBs named after our Unix usernames to test SQL syntax.

```
createdb <MY_UNIX_USERNAME>
```

### CREATE TABLE

This and the following SQL query exercises need to be run from within `psql`. Notice we are specifying the data type of the columns. See a full list of Postgres data types [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype.html).

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    weight INTEGER
);
```

### INSERT

Note that we are not specifying the id column in the INSERT statement.

```sql
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Mr. Snuggles', 'Calico', 327);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Jake AlPurrrrtsen', 'Bambino', 424);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Furry Mc Furmeister', 'Persian', 512);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Kai', 'LaPerm', 387);
```

#### Primary Key

In this course, for every table, we'll be naming a column called id. A feature of SQL systems is that we can have an auto-incrementing column that give an automatic and guaranteed unique number for every row created.

### SELECT

Get the name column from all rows.

```sql
SELECT name FROM cats;
```

Get the id and name column from all rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM cats;
```

Get the same columns in a different order.

```sql
SELECT name, id FROM cats;
```

Get all rows from all columns of this table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats;
```

### SELECT ... WHERE ...

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id=1;
```

### UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE cats SET name = 'Susan Chan' WHERE id=2;
```

### DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM cats WHERE id=2;
```

Note that a property of the unique `id` column is that if there is another insert query, the `id`s do not rearrange. Try this out by making a new `INSERT` query.

```sql
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Chubby Pants', 'Calico', 433);
```

### SELECT ... ORDER BY ...

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY name ASC;
```

### SELECT COUNT

```sql
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM cats;
```
