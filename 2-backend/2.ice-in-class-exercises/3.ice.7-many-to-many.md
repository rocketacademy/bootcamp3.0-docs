# 3.ICE.7: Many to Many

## Base

Create a command-line app to record workouts.

### App Setup

1. Begin with the [base Node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp)
2. Install the `pg` library with NPM.
3. Use the code from [3.4.2: PostgreSQL Node App](../3.4-sql-applications/3.4.2-postgresql-node-app.md#select) as a template for `index.js`. Remember to update `pgConnectionConfigs` to reference the new DB name.

### Set Up Database Schema

Create a new database and the following tables inside that database.

#### Exercise Table (`exercises`)

| column name | data type          | description          | example |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------- |
| id          | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID                   | 1       |
| name        | TEXT               | Name of the exercise | Pull up |

#### Workout Table (`workouts`)

| column name | data type          | description         | example     |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------- |
| id          | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID                  | 1           |
| name        | TEXT               | Name of the workout | Leg Tuesday |
| date        | TEXT               | Date of the workout | 3/3/2020    |

#### Join Table (`exercise_workouts`)

| column name  | data type          | description        | example |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------- |
| id           | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID                 | 1       |
| exercise\_id | INTEGER            | ID of the exercise | 1       |
| workout\_id  | INTEGER            | ID of the workout  | 1       |

### Insert Seed Data

Insert exercises into the `exercises` table. Find a list of exercises [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_weight\_training\_exercises).

### Output Exercises

Create a command to view all exercises in the DB.

```
node index.js exercises
```

#### Sample Output

```
1. deadlift
2. squat
```

### Create Workouts (With Existing Exercises)

Create a command to log workouts. When the user enters a new workout (with exercises) on the command line, our app creates a new entry in the `workouts` table AND adds the corresponding rows in the `exercise_workouts` table to associate the new workout with exercises.

When the following command runs it will take each input after the 5th input (after `<DATE>`) and assume that it is an ID of an exercise. For each of these IDs it will create a row in the `exercise_workouts` table.

#### Command Template

Square brackets in the command template reference optional values. In this case, the 2nd and onward exercise IDs are optional.

```
node index.js add-workout <WORKOUT_NAME> <DATE> <EXERCISE_ID> [<EXERCISE_ID> ...]
```

#### Sample Command

```
node index.js add-workout 'leg tuesday' '3/2/2020' 1 2
```

Because there is no limit to the exercise IDs that could be included in the command, we may wish to consider using [Rest Parameters](../../0-language-and-tooling/0.2-es6/0.2.3-es6-destructuring-spread-operators.md#rest-parameters) to parse `process.argv`, something like the following. In the following example, `workoutExercises` will be an array of all exercises input on the command line. We can then iterate over `workoutExercises` to insert the relevant records to our database.

```javascript
const [
  appName,
  scriptName,
  cmdName,
  workoutName,
  workoutDate,
  ...workoutExercises
] = process.argv;
```

### Get Workouts with Specific Exercise with Exercise ID

Create a command to get workouts by exercise. Use `exercise_id` to get all workouts with that exercise. Make an `INNER JOIN` query to list workout names with this exercise. Join on the `workouts` and `exercise_workouts` tables.

#### Command Template

```
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise <EXERCISE_ID>
```

#### Sample Command

```
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise 2
```

## Comfortable

### Get Workouts with Specific Exercise with Exercise Name

Use exercise name to get workouts instead of exercise ID. First query the `exercises` table to get the relevant exercise ID. Then follow the same logic as before to get workouts.

#### Command Template

```
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise <EXERCISE_NAME>
```

#### Sample Command

```
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise squat
```

### Save Workouts with Exercise Name

Do a nested query so that the user can save workout exercises by exercise name.

#### Command Template

Square brackets in the command template reference optional values. In this case, the 2nd and onward exercise names are optional.

```
node index.js add-workout <WORKOUT_NAME> <DATE> <EXERCISE_NAME> [<EXERCISE_NAME> ...]
```

#### Sample Command

```
node index.js add-workout 'leg tuesday' '3/2/2020' deadlift squat
```

## More Comfortable

### Add Muscles Table

Add another table `muscles` that gives body part categories to each exercise, like in the table [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_weight\_training\_exercises#Overview). An exercise will be associated with 1 or more muscles. Seed the `muscles` table with some muscles.

### Get Exercise by Muscle

Add a command that lists exercises by muscle name.

#### Command Template

```
node index.js get-exercise <MUSCLE_NAME>
```

#### Sample Command

```
node index.js get-exercise quads
```

### Get Workout by Muscle

Add a command that lists workouts by muscle name.

#### Command Template

```
node index.js get-workout-by-muscle <MUSCLE_NAME>
```

#### Sample Command

```
node index.js get-workout-by-muscle quads
```
