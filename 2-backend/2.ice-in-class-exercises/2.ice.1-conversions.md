# 2.ICE.1: Conversions

## Introduction

1. Begin with this [empty starter code repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).
2. Create an index.js file.
3. Put a `console.log` in the file and run it.
4. `console.log` `process` and `process.argv` variables. What do we observe?

#### index.js

```javascript
console.log('works!');
```

#### Sample Command

```bash
node index.js
```

## Conversion Apps

We will build conversion apps, similar to what we did in Coding Basics, as a way to familiarise ourselves with Node.js and command-line apps. Build the following apps that generate the relevant output when we run the following sample commands.

### Celsius-Fahrenheit Converter

Create an app that converts Celsius input to Fahrenheit output.

```bash
node index.js 0 # this outputs 32
```

### Multiple-Temperature Celsius-Fahrenheit Converter

Update our converter to support multiple Celsius inputs.

```bash
node multi.js 0 12 34 # this outputs: 32 53 93
```

### Bi-Directional Temperature Converter

Update our converter to take the source temperature unit and target temperature unit as input, in addition to temperature values. This should enable us to convert both ways, from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

```bash
node multi.js celcius fahrenheit 0 12 34 # this outputs: 32 53 93
```

### Bi-Directional Temperature Converter with Kelvin

Include conversion to and from Kelvin in our temperature converter.
