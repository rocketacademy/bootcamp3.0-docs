# 2.ICE.6: NPM, JSON File Storage

## NPM

1. Clone the [base Node repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).
2. Install the[ talk-like-a npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/talk-like-a) and set it to talk like a Swedish chef.
3. Write an app such that a user can run the following program on the command line with any text and the app will output a result.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: If using `import` syntax, we will need to import `talkLikeA` as a default export first, before using `talkLikeA.chef` to convert our output. This is because `talk-like-a` was built using old export syntax that only supports default exports.
{% endhint %}

#### Sample Input

```text
node index.js 'Hello! How are you today?'
```

#### Sample Output

```text
Hellu! Hoo ere-a yuoo tudey? Bork Bork Bork!
```

## `jsonFileStorage`

### Roll Dice and Save Value

Write an app such that when the user types the `roll` command, the computer rolls a dice and records the role in a local JSON file `data.json`.

#### Sample Command

```text
node index.js roll
```

#### Sample Output

```text
You rolled 6.
```

#### Sample `data.json`

```javascript
{
  "rolls": [6]
}
```

### Get Average Dice Roll

Update the app such that when the user types the `average` command, the computer outputs the average of all dice rolls so far.

#### Sample `data.json`

```javascript
{
  "rolls": [3, 3, 3]
}
```

#### Sample Command

```text
node index.js average
```

#### Sample Output

```text
Average is 3.
```

### Most Rolled Dice Number

1. Update the app to keep a JS Object frequency tally in `data.json` that tracks how many times the computer rolled each dice number.
2. Maintain this tally by incrementing the relevant value whenever the program rolls a new dice.
3. Each time the computer rolls a dice, output the most frequently rolled dice after the current dice roll.

#### Sample `data.json`

```javascript
{
  "rolls": [3, 3, 3, ...],
  "frequencies": {
    "1": 4,
    "2": 0,
    "3": 6,
    "4": 1,
    "5": 1,
    "6": 3
  }
}
```

#### Sample Command

```text
node index.js roll
```

#### Sample Output

```text
You rolled 6.
The computer has rolled 3 the most times.
```
