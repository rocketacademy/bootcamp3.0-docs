# 2.ICE.4: Servers and Requests

## Setup

Start with the [base Node repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).

## Simple Server

#### index.js

```javascript
import { createServer } from 'http';

const handleIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  console.log('Received request!');
  response.end('Yay!', 'utf-8');
};

createServer(handleIncomingRequest).listen(3004);
```

Open a new terminal and start your server.

```text
node index.js
```

## `ngrok`

![ngrok enables our computer to receive requests directly from the Internet.](../../.gitbook/assets/ngrok.jpg)

`ngrok` is a service that exposes our computers to the Internet by bypassing our LAN. Typically our computers would not be able to receive requests directly from the Internet.

We'll use `ngrok` to accept requests from others' computers. When we start `ngrok` it gives us a unique address. `ngrok` forwards any requests to that address to our computer at the port we specify.

### Install `ngrok`

[Install `ngrok`](../2.0-module-2-overview.md#ngrok) if you haven't already.

### Run `ngrok`

Start `ngrok` with the following command to send HTTP traffic to port 3004.

```text
ngrok http 3004
```

We should see the following output.

![ngrok gives us a public address that forwards to our local address. ](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-11-03-at-9.45.05-pm.png)

1. `ngrok` output will show us the public URL that now forwards to our local URL.
2. Open a new terminal window while keeping the `ngrok` window open. When we close the `ngrok` window, `ngrok` will stop forwarding from the public address to our local address.
3. Alter the code in our server above to give a special message to anyone who requests it.
4. Share the URL to your server in Slack so classmates can access it.

## File Server

1. Use the[ ](../2.10-http-file-server.md)[file server code from 2.10: HTTP File Server](../2.10-http-file-server.md#index-js) to serve your video poker files instead of a message.
   1. You may notice that your CSS files don't load. This is because when servers respond with non-text files, they need to send back a "MIME type" header to let the client know what type of file it is. Past student Zaffere wrote an explanation of how this works [here](https://pastebin.com/vCRjijqf).
2. Use the file server to serve the Bootstrap HTML files you may have created in [2.ICE.3: Disk Altering](2.ice.3-disk-altering.md#comfortable).
3. Use the file server to serve any other files you would like.

## Multiple Servers

1. Change the code of the original \(non-file\) server from port 3004 to port 3008.
2. Open a new terminal window and run it.
3. Open another, 4th terminal window and run another `ngrok`.
4. Post this server in Slack for classmates to access.

## Make Requests

Make requests to the servers others have posted in Slack with the following tools.

1. `curl`
2. Your browser
3. Node.js' `http.get` method

Verify that you are able to access others' servers exposed via `ngrok`. Do you notice any differences between responses from others' servers and your own?
