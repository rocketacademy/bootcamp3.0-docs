# 3.ICE.6: Inner Join

## Instructions

1. Create a new branch `inner-join` in the [3.ICE.5: One to Many](3.ice.5-one-to-many.md) repo for today's exercise, and work in the `inner-join` branch.
2. Refactor the Cat Owners command line app from [3.ICE.5: One to Many](3.ice.5-one-to-many.md) to use [INNER JOIN](../2.5-sql/2.5.1-sql-language/2.5.1.6-inner-join.md) instead of [nested SQL queries](../2.5-sql/2.5.3-sql-techniques/2.5.3.1-nested-sql-queries.md).
3. Complete [Comfortable](3.ice.5-one-to-many.md#comfortable) and [More Comfortable](3.ice.5-one-to-many.md#more-comfortable) sections in [3.ICE.5: One to Many](3.ice.5-one-to-many.md) if you have not already.
