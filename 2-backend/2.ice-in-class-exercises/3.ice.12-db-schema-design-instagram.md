# 3.ICE.12: DB Schema Design - Instagram

![Instagram Account Grid View](../../.gitbook/assets/mylenecybele-instagram-feed630.png)

## 

## Base

Design a database schema for Instagram.

### DB Setup

Create a new local database called `instagram`.

### ERD

Create a DB schema for Instagram by drawing an ERD for the DB, starting with only essentials That you would need to render the grid view of an account page. \(Assume you're rendering the web view of Instagram.\)

The real Instagram DB would have many tables, but we don't need to include everything for this exercise. In our ERD, name the tables and columns, identify data types, and define any relationships between the tables.

Try to move as quickly as possible onto the SELECT statements you need in order to render all the data on the page.

### `CREATE TABLE` Statements

Write and execute `CREATE TABLE` statements to create all tables and relationships in the ERD. Record these statements in a file `init_tables.sql`.

### `INSERT` Statements

Write and execute `INSERT` statements to insert dummy data into the tables. Record these statements in a file `seed.sql`.

### `SELECT` Statements

Write and execute sample `SELECT` queries you might need to render the account page above.

Don't worry about `INSERT` or `UPDATE` queries, or queries for searches. Record the `SELECT` statements in a file `queries.sql`.

## Comfortable

Add the DB tables, inserts and queries you would need for the functionality leading to and from this page, i.e, following, clicking on the stories button, etc. 

## More Comfortable

Add tables and columns for additional features such as Instagram Watch or messages.
