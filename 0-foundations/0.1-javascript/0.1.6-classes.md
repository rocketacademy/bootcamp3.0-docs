# 0.1.6: Classes

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the motivation behind JavaScript Classes and object-oriented programming (OOP)
2. Understand how to use JavaScript Class syntax to create and use classes

## Introduction

The following is an example of a JavaScript Class that represents cars. For simplicity, these cars only travel 1 unit of distance per trip.

```javascript
class Car {
  // Define class properties in a constructor method
  constructor(colour) {
    this.colour = color;
    this.odometer = 0;
  }
  
  // Define class methods within the class block
  drive() {
    this.odometer += 1;
  }
}

// Create new "instances" of classes with the "new" keyword
const whiteCar = new Car('white');
const blackCar = new Car('black');

// Call class methods on instances of the class
whiteCar.drive();
blackCar.drive();
blackCar.drive();

// Retrieve class properties as we would with JS Objects
console.log(whiteCar.odometer); // 1
console.log(blackCar.odometer); // 2
```

JavaScript Classes are templates for entities we may wish to manipulate as a unit in our apps. Classes are part of a broader computer science concept called object-oriented programming, also known as OOP. Classes are optional in JavaScript but mandatory in languages such as Java.&#x20;

## Without classes

Without classes, we might store data in JavaScript Objects and manipulate them with helper functions.

```javascript
const whiteCar = {
  colour: 'white',
  odometer: 0
};

const blackCar = {
  colour: 'black',
  odometer: 0
};

const drive = (car) => {
  car.odometer += 1;
}
```

To reduce redundancy in object creation, we could write a helper function like `createCar` to generate our objects.

```javascript
const createCar = (colour) => {
  return {
    colour: colour,
    odometer: 0
  };
}

const drive = (car) => {
  car.odometer += 1;
}

const whiteCar = createCar("white");
const blackCar = createCar("black");
```

## With Classes

JavaScript Classes encapsulate the entity properties (`colour` and `odometer` above), entity creation method (`createCar` above) and any entity helper methods (`drive` above) within a single unit, i.e. class. This helps us organise our code by thinking of a `Car` as a single entity, instead of an entity spread across disparate objects and helper functions.

```javascript
class Car {
  // Define class properties in a constructor method
  constructor(colour) {
    this.colour = color;
    this.odometer = 0;
  }
  
  // Define class methods within the class block
  drive() {
    this.odometer += 1;
  }
}

// Create new "instances" of classes with the "new" keyword
const whiteCar = new Car('white');
const blackCar = new Car('black');
```

We can represent many common app entities as classes, for example users.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name, email, password) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
    // Always only store hashed passwords to mitigate problems if data stolen
    this.passwordHash = hash(password);
  }
  
  changePassword(newPassword) {
    this.passwordHash = hash(newPassword);
  }
}

const joe = new User("Joe", "joe@joe.com", "joerox");
const amy = new User("Amy", "amy@amy.com", "amyrox");
```
