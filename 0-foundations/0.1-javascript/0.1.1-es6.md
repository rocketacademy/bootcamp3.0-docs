# 0.1.1: ES6

## Learning Objectives

1. Know that ES6 is today's de-facto JavaScript language version

## Introduction

[ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js\_es6.asp) is today's de-facto JavaScript language version. JS began with few features and has since included many more. Every coding language has maintainers that release new versions over time.&#x20;

Browser compatibility is a primary consideration for JS version because frontend JS runs in our users' browsers, whose versions we do not control. Older browsers may not be able to run newer versions of JS. This is why later JS versions such as ES7 are not yet widely-adopted. We can still use ES7 with "compilation" programs such as Webpack to compile our code into browser-friendly syntax.
