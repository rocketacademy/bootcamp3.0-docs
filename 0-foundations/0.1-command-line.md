# 0.1: Command Line

## Learning Objectives

1. The command line is a text interface for manipulating our computers
2. Navigate folders and display folder contents in the command line
3. Create new folders and files in the command line
4. Rename or delete folders and files in the command line

## Introduction

The command line, also known as "terminal" is a text-based computer interface. We will use the command line to manage files, use Git version control and run Node applications. Using the command line is separate from writing application code, though we will need the command line to build apps effectively.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are a Windows user, please use the VS Code terminal connected to Ubuntu in WSL. The Windows Command Prompt runs PowerShell by default which is not compatible with Unix-based commands that most software engineers use. See [Windows Command Line Setup](../logistics/required-software.md#install-and-setup-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl) for details.

## Common Commands

Below, we have listed some of the most commonly used terminal commands that software engineers use. To learn more about these commands, google "man" followed by the command name to get the "manual" page for the command (eg. to learn more about "pwd", simply enter "man pwd" into google).

**Tab Complete**

The command line will autocomplete file and folder names if we press `tab` after starting to type their names. This can save us a lot of typing!

## Common Special Paths

The following paths are shortcuts to common locations and are often used in folder navigation.

| Path | Meaning                                              | Sample Usage                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`  | Root, i.e. the highest-level folder on our computers | `cd /Users/joe/rocket/project1` | All absolute paths begin with the root folder `/`                                                                                                                                |
| `~`  | Home, i.e. the logged-in user's home folder          | `cd ~`                          | `~` is an alias for `/Users/username`, where `username` is the username of the logged-in user                                                                                    |
| `..` | Parent folder                                        | `cd ..`                         | Every folder has a hidden link `..` that references the parent folder. `cd ..` changes directory to the parent folder without having to reference the name of the parent folder. |
| .    | Current folder                                       | `mv components/App.js .`        | `.` is most commonly used to move files or folders from elsewhere to the current folder                                                                                          |

## Exercise

Run each of the above commands with local files and folders. Verify file and folder changes in Ubuntu File Manager or MacOS Finder.
