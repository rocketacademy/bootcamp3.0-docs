A GitHub "[**pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)" (PR) is a request to pull changes from 1 repo on GitHub to another. PRs are most commonly used as a _code-review mechanism_, where developers submit PRs for review before merging the code in those PRs to their company's shared repo. We will use PRs in Coding Basics to submit projects.

When we've pushed our changes to our repo, we'll click the "Pull requests" button to create a new pull request.
