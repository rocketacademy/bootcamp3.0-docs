# 0.5: GitHub

## Learning Objectives

1. GitHub is a code-hosting website that hosts Git repos for individuals or teams to review and collaborate on
2. GitHub (and other code-hosting platforms such as BitBucket, GitLab) serve as the source of truth for project repos shared among teams
3. Know how to view repo commit history in GitHub

## Introduction

GitHub is a code-hosting website that hosts Git repos for individuals or teams to review and collaborate on. Team members can easily review latest code changes and commit history, making software development more transparent and thorough.

## How to view commit history in GitHub

Reviewing commit history is one of the most useful features of GitHub. For example, if we are wondering which commit changed a line of code that caused a bug, we can easily find which commits changed that line, who made those commits and what else was in those commits.&#x20;
