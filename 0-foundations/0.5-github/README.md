# 0.5: GitHub

## Learning Objectives

1. GitHub is a code-hosting website that hosts Git repositories for individuals or teams to review and collaborate on
2. GitHub (and other code-hosting platforms such as BitBucket, GitLab) serve as the source of truth for project repos shared among teams

## Introduction

We'll use GitHub to download starter code, and after we learn forking, pushing, pulling and pull requests, we'll use it to submit projects and store our code online.
