GitHub is a web application that hosts Git repositories on the internet. It is a centralised set of repositories developers use to hold "official" copies of their code.

### Why Use GitHub?

We'll use GitHub to download starter code, and after we cover forking and pull requests we'll use it to submit projects and store our code online.
