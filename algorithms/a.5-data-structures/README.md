# A.5: Data Structures

We've already been using data structures to represent our data. We've used such structures as: the hash map, which is called an object in JavaScript and a dictionary in Python.

In a Computer Science context a data structure is something distinct from a language-level implementation that holds values in memory, i.e., `var arr = [1,2];` is a JavaScript language-specific implementation of the array data structure.

We'll be seeing array data structures that happen to already be implemented into the Python and JavaScript languages, but we'll also be seeing things like trees and graphs, which are data structures that are not implemented in any language we'll be using. Computer Science does not make a distinction between a data structures that are implemented at the language level and those that are not. Both are analyzed for complexity in the same way.
