# A.1: Intro to SWE Interviews

## Learning Objectives

1. Know what to expect for each interview type

## Introduction

We may not be able to control interview outcomes, but we can control our familiarity with common interview patterns to maximise our chances. Below are common SWE interview types and what to expect from each.

## Take-Home Assignment

Common initial interview. Typically takes 2-3 days and involves building a simple app related to the company's business in a language of our choice.

Companies typically assess take-home assignments on both completion and code quality. Completion is simpler: does the app meet requirements. Code quality is more subjective, but typically refers to clarity in naming, commenting and decomposition.

Companies often follow-up with an on-site or Zoom interview to verify the candidate knows what they were doing and can communicate decisions clearly. Be sure to revise your code and decisions before meeting them!

## Culture Fit Interview

Standard "get to know you" interviews. Be yourself and show you care by asking your interviewer questions about their job and company.&#x20;

## Algorithm Interview

Most typical SWE interview. Typically consists of solving an algorithm problem in 30-60 minutes in a language of our choice. See [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) for examples.

Algorithm problems have a fixed number of common patterns we can master with practice. We will practice algorithms throughout Bootcamp to familiarise ourselves with common patterns.

## System Design Interview

Less common in entry-level interviews. Typically consists of designing and explaining software architecture, e.g. drawing a diagram of frontend and backend components in an app and explaining how components work together. More common in mid and senior-level interviews because senior engineers spend more time designing architecture. Impressive if entry-level engineer can do systems design.

## Language-Specific Trivia

Less common interview type, mostly asked by teams dependent on more niche languages such as Java (banks, consultancies that work with banks) or Solidity and Rust (Web3). Rocket has also seen some consultancies test for SQL knowledge.
