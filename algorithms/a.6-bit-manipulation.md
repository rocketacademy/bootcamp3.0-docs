# A.6: Bit Manipulation

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand that computers store values in code as sequences of bits (data type with value 0 or 1). Computers represent numbers with bits in [binary format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_number).
2. Bit manipulation refers to manipulation of the bits that form a value using bitwise operators
3. Know the 6 most common bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `~`, `^`, `<<`, and `>>`) and what they do

## Introduction

Computers store all data as sequences of 0s and 1s in a data type called a "bit". Programming languages like JavaScript automatically translate JavaScript to bits for us, thus we rarely need to think of bits while building apps. However, there are [several algorithm problems](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2097062) occasionally tested in interviews that can be solved more efficiently by manipulating bits with bitwise operators instead of usual JavaScript commands, thus we learn bit manipulation.

Bit manipulation refers to changing bits in a value using bitwise operators. In the algorithm interview context, this typically involves manipulating bits that represent numbers.&#x20;

There are 6 most common bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `~`, `^`, `<<`, and `>>`. Let us examine them in a table.

| Operator | Name                                              | Example  | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&`      | Bitwise And                                       | `a & b`  | Compare bits of values `a` and `b` and produce a result based on the comparison. In the result, bits in each position that were both 1 in `a` and `b` stay 1, otherwise become 0. |
| `\|`     | Bitwise Or                                        | `a \| b` | Compare bits of values `a` and `b` and produce a result based on the comparison. In each bit of the result, if either `a` or `b` had a 1 bit in that position, that bit is now 1. |
| `~`      | Bitwise Not                                       | `~a`     | Produce a result where all bits in `a` are reversed. If any bit in `a` was 0, the same bit in the result is 1 and vice versa.                                                     |
| `^`      | Bitwise Xor (pronounced "x-or" or "exclusive or") | `a ^ b`  | Same as Bitwise Or, except if the same bit in both values is 1, that bit is 0 in the result.                                                                                      |
| `<<`     | Bitwise Left Shift                                | `a << 1` | Shift all bits in `a` to the left by the number to the right of the operator, inserting a 0 bit to the right of the original number for every shift.                              |
| `>>`     | Bitwise Right Shift                               | `a >> 1` | Shift all bits in `a` to the right by the number to the right of the operator, deleting the right-most bit of the original number with every shift.                               |

## Exercises

### Pre-Class

1. Decode XORed Array ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-xored-array/))
   1. Hint: If `A XOR B == C`, then `C XOR A == B` and `C XOR B == A`.

### Part 1

Hint: For JavaScript, consider using the built-in [`toString(2)`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9939785) method on numbers to convert integers (aka decimal numbers) to binary numbers, and `toString(10)` to convert binary numbers to integers. For Python, consider using the equivalent built-in functions `bin` and `int`.
