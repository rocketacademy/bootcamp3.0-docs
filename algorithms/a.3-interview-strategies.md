# A.3: Algorithm Interview Strategies

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand techniques to succeed at algorithm interviews

## Introduction

The following strategies will greatly increase our chances of success.

1. Clarify Problem
2. Think Out Loud
3. Naive Solution
4. Pseudocode First
5. Think of Test Cases
6. Can We Do Better?

## Clarify Problem

Always clarify the interview problem before starting; Understanding the problem is half the battle. This shows initiative, communication skills, and an outcome-driven mindset.&#x20;

Clarifications often include:

1. Sample inputs and outputs
2. Constraints on solutions, e.g. run time, data structures
3. Any other ambiguities

## Think Out Loud

Think out loud when solving the problem. Thinking out loud greatly increases our chances of success because it demonstrates communication skills, earns partial credit and helps the interviewer help us. Algorithms interviews test problem-solving ability, not memorisation, and thinking out loud shows how we solve problems.

## Naive Solution

Start with the naive solution so you have something to fall back on if you are unable to create a more efficient solution. The naive solution is typically a brute-force method that may not pass time limits but at least works.

## Pseudocode First

Write pseudocode before code to clarify our algorithm without worrying about syntax, which will save us debugging time later. Where possible, optimise our algorithm in pseudocode before writing code.&#x20;

## Think of Test Cases

Test code on inputs that might break it. More often that not, algorithm problems do not provide comprehensive test cases. This is a strong signal for problem solving independence and thoroughness.&#x20;

## Can We Do Better?

Is there a solution with less time and space complexity? The most impressive candidates develop multiple solutions, each with time and space tradeoffs, and communicate those tradeoffs clearly. They can then decide with the interviewer which solution to implement.
