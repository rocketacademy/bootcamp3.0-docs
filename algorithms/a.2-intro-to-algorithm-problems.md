# A.2: Intro to Algorithm Problems

## Learning Objectives

1. Know the general format of algorithm interview problems
2. Understand how to solve basic algorithm problems
3. Be familiar with LeetCode and HackerRank problem format

## Introduction

Algorithm problems test 3 things:

1. Have we worked hard enough to get good at algos
2. Are we able to logically deduce a solution to an algorithmic problem
3. Are we able to communicate our thought processes clearly when solving a problem

Understanding the problem is half the battle, and we encourage asking as many questions as we need to our interviewer until we understand the problem.

Below are simple algorithm problems for us to understand their format and what to expect.

## Exercises

Solve each exercise by writing a function that satisfies the requirements. You will need to create LeetCode and HackerRank accounts if you haven't already.

**Recommended learning strategy**

For a given problem, if you cannot think of a way to solve the problem after 15 minutes, check the solutions or submissions to understand how others solved the problem. Come back to the problem after a few days and attempt the problem again. This will save us time and help us learn faster, because many problems follow the same patterns.
