## Introduction

Algorithm problems are some of the most common coding interview problems. They will be similar to questions asked on popular interview prep platforms such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or mentioned in well-known interview prep material such as [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). With enough practice we can get good enough at algorithms to pass algorithm interviews from any company.
