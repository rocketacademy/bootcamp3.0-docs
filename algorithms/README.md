## Introduction

Algorithm problems are the most common coding interview problems. They will be similar to questions on popular interview prep platforms such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com), or in well-known interview prep material such as [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com). With enough practice we can master algorithms and pass algorithm interviews from any company.
