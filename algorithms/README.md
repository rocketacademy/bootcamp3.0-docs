## Introduction

Algorithm problems are the most common coding interview problems. They will be similar to questions on popular interview prep platforms such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or in well-known interview prep material such as Cracking the Coding Interview (file below). With enough practice we can master algorithms and pass algorithm interviews from any company.
