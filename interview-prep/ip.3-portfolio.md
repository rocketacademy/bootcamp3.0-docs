# IP.3: Portfolio

## Introduction

Your portfolio is your summary of all the coding work you've done. The goal of the portfolio (similar to a resume) is to impress prospective employers, ideally within 5 seconds of them looking at the page, such that they are willing to dig deeper into your projects and code and/or invite you for an interview.

## What to include in your portfolio

Rocket recommends we build our portfolios as public [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) pages to focus more on content and less UI.
