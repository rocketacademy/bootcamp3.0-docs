# Course Methodology

## Flipped Classroom

Rocket adopts a flipped-classroom model where Rocket expects students to review lectures and course materials before class, and spend class time clarifying concepts and completing exercises with the guidance of a section leader.

## Difficulty Levels

Rocket provides multiple levels of difficulty to accommodate different learning speeds and prior experience. Students can complete Bootcamp without attempting Comfortable, but students that complete Comfortable may have a firmer grasp of concepts. Rocket recommends completing Base for all of each day's post-class and pre-class exercises before attempting Comfortable.

### Base

Bare minimum. All students must complete Base to understand concepts.

### Comfortable

Reinforce with further exercises around same concepts. For students that wish to deepen understanding of current concepts before moving onto new ones.

### More Comfortable

Deepest exercises that Rocket offers for each concept. For students that wish to push the limits of their understanding of the current concepts.

## Project Methodology

### Ideation Phase 1

Brainstorm app ideas and solicit feedback from your section in Slack. What problem does the app solve, for whom? How does the app solve the problem? What data does the app handle? Feel free to use [Rocket's project planning template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klyi92bVHUKjxgD\_Saou\_u6yoEZFbzkvbttj2izh8xg/edit?usp=sharing) to guide you.

### Ideation Phase 2

Create the following planning docs, save them in the project GitHub repo and share them with your section in Slack for feedback. Your SL will review your planning docs with you before you begin implementation.

#### All Projects

1. User stories
2. Wireframes
3. Kanban board

#### Project 2 Onward

1. DB schema outline (NoSQL) or DB ERD (SQL)

### Scrum

Professional tech teams typically run using [Agile Scrum Methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum). Rocket simulates this during Bootcamp project weeks. Each course day students will share the following with their section to keep each other on track.

1. What did you do between the previous course day and today?
2. What do you plan to do between today and the next course day?
3. Do you have any blockers?

### Presentations

Students present projects in class on the last day of each module. Presentations should cover the following.

1. App demo
2. App development strategy
3. Biggest challenges faced
4. What you might do differently next time

### Post-Mortem

After each project your section leader will review your code with you 1-1. Please prepare answers to below questions before meeting. Consider recording notes; past students have found post-mortem notes helpful for resumes and portfolios.

Consider questions from both a technical and process perspective.

1. What went well? Please share a link to the specific code.
2. What were the biggest challenges you faced? Please share a link to the specific code.
3. What would you do differently next time?

### Demo Video

Record a video after each project to showcase your hard work for your portfolio and employers.

#### Requirements

1. Demo your app in a 1-2 minute video (brevity is best!)
2. Explain who your app is for, what their problem is and how they would solve their problem with your app
3. Use language that non-technical recruiters would understand
4. Record locally with Zoom with your face in the upper-right corner. Upload to YouTube and embed a video link in your project `README`.

#### Past Examples

These batches did not have a time limit; please keep yours under 2 minutes if possible.

## Sharing Code with Classmates

In software engineering, there are so many different ways to solve the same problem. One great way to maximise learning to have a look at how your friends completed the same exercises!

### Part 1: Sharing your solution

1. To start off any project, you will have to go to the starter repo and fork the repo.
2. Next, you will go to this new forked repo and `git clone` it down to your filesystem.
3. You are now ready to go work on your project and make all the required changes.
4. It'll be great to include a `README.md` that includes
   1. A brief description of your app
   2. How to setup and run your app
   3. For example, see [https://github.com/jiachen247/bootcamp/tree/master/M3/3-ICE-1/bigfoot-express-bootcamp](https://github.com/jiachen247/bootcamp/tree/master/M3/3-ICE-1/bigfoot-express-bootcamp)
5. Once done, you can go on to commit and push the files as per usual
   1. `git add .`
   2. `git commit -m "insert commit message here"`
   3. `git push`
6. Once the push is successfully, you should see it on your forked repo on Github.
7. Go on to make a Pull Request (from your forked repo to the original starter repo)
   1. Please name the PR "\<Your name> \<Bootcamp batch>" eg. "Jiachen FTBC6"

### Part 2: Checking out your classmates' solutions

1. To view your classmates' solutions, you can go to the starter repo and click the Pull Request (PR) tab.
2. Next, you search for your bootcamp batch (eg. FTBC6) and all your classmates PRs should be listed there.
   1. For example, see [https://github.com/rocketacademy/html-noodles-bootcamp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+FTBC6](https://github.com/rocketacademy/html-noodles-bootcamp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+FTBC6)
3. You can then view their code under the File Changes tab in the PR to view all the changes they have made.
4. To run and build their project locally, you can click on their forked repo in the PR and `git clone` it down as usual to run the project.
5. Once cloned, you can follow the README to setup and run the app!

## Peer Code Review

Occasionally we will review each others' code to learn from each other. Start by reviewing your partner's code individually, before discussing the review in pairs.

### Part 1: Individual

1. Clone partner's code
2. Read partner's code
   1. How does it work?
   2. How is it different from my implementation?
   3. What can I learn from this?
3. Run partner's code
   1. If you're not sure how certain code might behave, run it. Feel free to edit the code to verify your understanding.
4. Complete code review on partner's GitHub pull request to help them improve

### Part 2: In Pairs

1. Review learnings from individual code reviews
2. Pair program on 1 person's code to get a working version. The person with the weaker understanding of the current concepts should be the driver. For more info on pair programming, read [Rocket's primer on pair programming in Coding Basics](https://codingbasics.rocketacademy.co/logistics/course-methodology/course-components#pair-programming).

## Using Google as a Resource

Students will need to use Google as a resource to solve problems not explained in Rocket's curriculum. Rocket will do our best to document the most common mistakes, but it would be impossible to document all. Professional SWEs spend most time finding answers on Google, and googling effectively may be your most important takeaway from Bootcamp.

With experience you will know when you are on the right track. Often it takes multiple permutations of Google search keywords to find the answer we are looking for. The goal when reading documentation, Stack Overflow or forum answers is to find relevant information as quickly as possible without reading more than necessary.
