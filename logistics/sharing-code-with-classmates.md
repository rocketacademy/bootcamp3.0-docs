  problem. One great way to maximise learning to have a look at how your friends
  completed the same exercises!

# Sharing Code with Classmates

## Part 1: Sharing your solution

1. To start off any project, you will have to go starter repo and fork the repo.
   - ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (2) (1).png>)
2. Next, you will go to this new forked repo and `git clone` it down your filesystem.
3. You are now ready to go work on your project and make all the required changes.
4. It'll be great to include a README.md that includes&#x20;
   1. A brief description of your app
   2. How to setup and run your app
   3. For example, see [https://github.com/jiachen247/bootcamp/tree/master/M3/3-ICE-1/bigfoot-express-bootcamp](https://github.com/jiachen247/bootcamp/tree/master/M3/3-ICE-1/bigfoot-express-bootcamp)
5. Once done, you can go on to commit and push the files as per usual
   1. `git add .`&#x20;
   2. `git commit -m "-insert commit message here"`
   3. `git push`
6. Once the push is successfully, you should see it on your forked repo on Github.
7. Go on to make a Pull Request (from your forked repo to the original starter repo)
   1. Please name the PR "\<your name> \<bootcamp batch>" eg. "Jiachen FTBC6"

## Part 2: Checking out your classmate's solutions

1. To view your classmates solutions, you can go to the starter repo and click the Pull Request (PR) tab.
2. Next, you search for your bootcamp batch (eg. FTBC6) and all your classmates PRs should be listed there.
   1. For example, see [https://github.com/rocketacademy/html-noodles-bootcamp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+FTBC6](https://github.com/rocketacademy/html-noodles-bootcamp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+FTBC6)
3. You can then view they code under the File Changes tab in the PR to view all the changes they have made.
4. To run and build their project locally, you can click on their forked repo in the PR and `git clone` it down as usual to run the project.
   1. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)
5. Once cloned, you can follow the README to setup and run the app!
