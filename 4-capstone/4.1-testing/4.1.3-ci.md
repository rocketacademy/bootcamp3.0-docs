# 4.1.3: CI

CI stands for continuous integration. This is a system of app deployment that happens automatically based on a piece of infrastructure called a Continuous Integration tool. We'll be using GitHub actions, which comes bundled for free with every GitHub repo.

Our CI system will run the tests in the repo and also deploy to Heroku.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub actions are sets of specifications and command line commands that are run on a given trigger.

## Sample Repo

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp)

Deployed App: [https://dry-everglades-81776.herokuapp.com/](https://dry-everglades-81776.herokuapp.com/)

### All Deployments

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp/actions](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp/actions)

The actions tab is the control panel for all the actions running against the repo. You can see detailed reports of what happened during deployment in this tab.

### Node Action

This action tells GitHub to run all tests when a new commit is pushed to the repo, or a new pull request is made on main branch.

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp/blob/main/.github/workflows/node.js.yml](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp/blob/main/.github/workflows/node.js.yml)

#### ./github/workflows/node.js.yml

```yaml
# This workflow will do a clean install of node dependencies, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions

name: Node.js CI

# run this action when there is a push to main or a pull request on main
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    # specify which operating system to run this on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x]
        # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci # install the dependencies
      - run: npm test # run the tests
```

### Heroku Action

Setup your Heroku app to allow access to the GitHub action. See the configuration steps here: [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku)

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp/blob/main/.github/workflows/heroku.yml](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ci-bootcamp/blob/main/.github/workflows/heroku.yml)

#### ./github/workflows/heroku.yml

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}
          heroku_app_name: "<HEROKU_APP_NAME>" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku_email: "<HEROKU_USER_EMAIL>"
```

## Adding New Actions

Actions can either be added by naming a new [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file \(YAML is similar to JSON\) in `.github/workflows` or creating a new action on the GitHub repo website in the actions tab. If properly configured they should appear in the actions list.

## Exercise

Add a Heroku and node testing action to one of the repos you own.
