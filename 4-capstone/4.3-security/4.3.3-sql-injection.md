# 4.3.3: SQL Injection

SQL injection means the ability of an attacker to run some arbitrary SQL code against the app database using some SQL language syntax techniques.

The following link makes a GET request to the API part of the app: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/express-security-bootcamp/blob/main/index.js\#L315-L327](https://github.com/rocketacademy/express-security-bootcamp/blob/main/index.js#L315-L327)

The end of this link has some SQL statements appended to the end of it.

```sql
' UNION SELECT email, password FROM users--
```

After the complete query is constructed it looks like this: \(take a look at the console.log that prints this query out\).

```sql
SELECT name,type from cats WHERE name='kai' UNION SELECT email, password FROM users--'
```

According to the source UNION "_lets you execute an additional `SELECT` query and append the results to the original query_".

You can learn more about this example query here: [https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)

Here is the link to the app: \[[https://express-security-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/api/cats/kai' UNION SELECT email, password FROM users--\]\(https://express-security-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/api/cats/kai' UNION SELECT email, password FROM users--](https://express-security-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/api/cats/kai'%20UNION%20SELECT%20email,%20password%20FROM%20users--]%28https://express-security-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/api/cats/kai'%20UNION%20SELECT%20email,%20password%20FROM%20users--)\)

Notice that it prints out a list of all users and their passwords.

## SQL Injection Solutions

The main part of the app that exposes this vulnerability is this line: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/express-security-bootcamp/blob/main/index.js\#L317](https://github.com/rocketacademy/express-security-bootcamp/blob/main/index.js#L317)

Raw concatenation of request parameters into a SQL query should be avoided. \(This applies anywhere in the query, not just if there is a WHERE clause\).

```javascript
const query =
  "SELECT name, type from cats WHERE name='" + request.params.name + "'";
```

Parameterized SQL queries will not have the same problems. The following syntax is preferred in all cases.

```javascript
const query = "SELECT name, type from cats WHERE name=$1";
values = [request.params.name];
```
