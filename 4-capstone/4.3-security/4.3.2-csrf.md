# 4.3.2: CSRF

![](../../.gitbook/assets/v184yggcq5s41.jpg)

A request can be sent as the viewing user and /or a request can be forged by an attacker.

CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is when a request that is supposed to originate from something like a form submit is actually generated from somewhere else on the internet.

**1. CSRF Part 1: Be able to create a request**

A link or other mechanism must be put in place such that the victim's browser creates an unwanted request. This link could also be hidden in the `src` of an image tag, or simply posted as a link for others to click on.

For example, the sample app is made so that we do not check for CSRF.

The following link will reset the password of a logged in user who clicks on it: [https://express-security-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/?email=someemail@attacker.com&password=1234](https://express-security-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/?email=someemail@attacker.com&password=1234)

**2. CSRF Part 2: Accept a request that is not authentic**

The relevant code is here:[https://github.com/rocketacademy/express-security-bootcamp/blob/main/index.js\#L187-L200](https://github.com/rocketacademy/express-security-bootcamp/blob/main/index.js#L187-L200)

The route uses GET instead of POST or PUT. Even though it verifies the user, if the user had clicked on the above link, they would have been logged in, and their password would have been changed.

The original intention of this Express.js route is that the GET request originates from a form within the app, but in this case it comes from a malicious link that was created above by the attacker.

```javascript
app.get("/user/edit", checkAuth, (request, response) => {
  const values = [
    request.query.email,
    getHash(request.query.password),
    request.cookies.userId,
  ];

  pool
    .query("UPDATE users SET email=$1 password=$2 WHERE id=$3", values)
    .then((result) => {
      response.send("done");
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("Error executing query", error.stack);
      response.status(503).send("sorry");
    });
});
```

## CSRF Solutions

For every request we can add on another layer of verification so that the system knows that the request was either generated from a form originating on the site or from JavaScript originating from the site.

The Express.js documentation details installing the [csurf middleware. ](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/csurf.html)
