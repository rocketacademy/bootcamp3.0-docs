# 4.P: Capstone

## Introduction

Build an app that solves a problem you have using any technologies. Rocket encourages you to use at least 1 technology you have not used before. Rocket expects you to justify your technology choices and articulate tradeoffs between available options. This project can be done individually or in a group.

## Requirements

You are free to build any app with any technologies. This app must have at least the same level of complexity as those for P2 and P3. If in doubt, ask your section leader.

### App

1. Unit testing for non-CRUD logic in the backend
2. Continuous integration that runs unit tests on pushes to GitHub

### Other

1. Deployment to internet
2. Naming, casing and commenting [best practices](../general-reference/naming-casing-and-commenting-conventions.md)
3. Git commits for each feature with descriptive commit messages
4. App description in README with user stories and low-fidelity wireframes (if relevant)
5. Instructions in README to run app

## Ideas

Solve a problem you have with 1 or more new technologies. Past students have built web apps, mobile apps, data visualisations, worked with blockchain, graphics, machine learning. Follow your interests, and consider how you might present this project to target employers for a job. If you are keen on working in a specific industry, consider building a project related to that industry.

If you wish to build an app that involves real-time location tracking in a virtual world, consider using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) over Firebase for lower latency. If you wish to build an app that involves live-streaming video or audio, consider using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), the technology used by Zoom, Google, and Facebook for their video-conferencing apps.

## Timeline

You will have almost twice the amount of time for your capstone than other projects. Consider using the first days to experiment with new technologies before deciding on an idea and tech stack.

## Setup

Feel free to use setups from past projects or a completely new setup depending on the technologies you are using.

## Deployment

Please deploy using any deployment tool that makes most sense for your app. Feel free to try new tools that we have not used before in Bootcamp.

## Submission

Add your Project 4 repo link to the [Rocket Bootcamp Projects spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZ39naj5E6mNNkQ1akR\_FgeFO\_kM6aWCAr8zqrFOkt4/edit?usp=sharing) in your batch-specific sheet. Feel free to review past student projects in previous batches' sheets.
