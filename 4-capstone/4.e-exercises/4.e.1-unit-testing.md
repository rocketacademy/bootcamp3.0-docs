# 4.ICE.1: Unit Testing

Clone the card game repo and checkout this branch: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-bootcamp/tree/unit-test-highcard-tests](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-bootcamp/tree/unit-test-highcard-tests)

Familiarize yourself with the game and how it works.

The game does not say when the user has run out of cards in the deck. Add the functionality to the game so that the game ends when the deck is empty. Add a unit test to test this functionality.

Add the ability for the user to play with a new deck. Write unit tests for this functionality.
