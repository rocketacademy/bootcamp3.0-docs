# CSS.POCE.1: Flexbox Docs Page

## Instructions

Begin with the starter code repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp).

**We will create the same technical documentation page** [**here**](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL)**.**

Note that this version is responsive:

1. Mobile-first is stacked vertically.
2. Desktop layout is 2 column.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hints:

Use the advanced properties of Flexbox, including `flex-wrap`, `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`.

For reference, see RA's code example codepen [here](https://codepen.io/awongh-sandwich/pen/XWjvrQJ).

Copy the example into the starter code. Play with the codepen example above to understand how it works.

What happens when we take off `flex-wrap` in different screen widths? What about `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow`?
