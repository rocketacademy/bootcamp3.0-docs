# CSS.POCE.2: Flexbox Personal Page

## Introduction

This is a summation of the responsive layout and Flexbox material so far. We'll make a fully-responsive page using Flexbox and media queries, in addition to other basic styles such as display and margin.

## Instructions

1. Begin with the starter code repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp). We will create the same personal page as in the [sample page.](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG)
2. Use Flexbox and media queries to achieve the responsive behaviour in the [sample page.](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG)
3. Begin with the mobile layout first and use media queries to apply layout styles needed for the larger layout sizes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For mobile-first layouts we need to add the following `meta` tag in the HTML head. Read more about this tag [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport\_meta\_tag)

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
{% endhint %}
