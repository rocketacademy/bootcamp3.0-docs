# CSS.ICE.6: NTU

## Instructions

1. Clone RA's [Basic Bootstrap repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basic-bootstrap-bootcamp).
2. Use Bootstrap to recreate the [NTU About page](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/about-us) based on the following screenshots of an older version.
   1. The screenshots may look slightly different from NTU's actual website because we removed certain elements for simplicity.
   2. Remember to make the site responsive and work on the mobile version of the site first.
3. For images, link to or download the NTU website's images.
