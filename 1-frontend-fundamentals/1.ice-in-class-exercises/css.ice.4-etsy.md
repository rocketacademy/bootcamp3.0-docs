# CSS.ICE.4: Etsy

## Introduction

![](../../.gitbook/assets/etsy.jpg)

Recreate the website screenshot above. Note that this is not the real version of this page. Begin with this starter code repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp)

Given the limited time for this exercise, begin by coding the top and bottom of the page before adding each middle section. Refer to the [cheatsheet](../css-1-basic-css.md#exercise-tips-cheatsheet) to make the page easier to code.

This exercise is only for the mobile view of this page. To make this page look good on a laptop/desktop, put the contents of the site inside a container element. Set the `max-width` CSS style on this element and center the element using `margin: 0 auto;`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For mobile first layouts we need to add the scaling tag in the head. Read more about the `viewport` tag [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport\_meta\_tag)

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
{% endhint %}
