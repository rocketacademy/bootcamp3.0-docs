# CSS.ICE.2: Wikipedia

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/wiki.png)

Recreate the website screenshot above.

Begin with this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp)

This exercise is only for the mobile view of this page. To make this page look good on a laptop/desktop, put the contents of the site inside a container element. Set the `max-width` CSS style on this element and center the element using `margin: 0 auto;`.

For mobile first layouts we need to add the scaling tag in the head:

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```

Read more about the `viewport` tag [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport\_meta\_tag)
