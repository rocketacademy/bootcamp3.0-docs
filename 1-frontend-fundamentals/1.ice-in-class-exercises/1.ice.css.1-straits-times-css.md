# CSS.ICE.1: Personal Portfolio Site

Today you are going to start designing your own personal website that will showcase all the projects you will do in this bootcamp. &#x20;

Begin with this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp)

* Create a wireframe for the site
* Create the HTML page, making sure to use semantic tags as needed
* Choose a font family for the site:   [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com)
* Choose a color scheme for the site: [https://www.color-hex.com/](https://www.color-hex.com)
* Create the selectors to use on the site. &#x20;
* Add the rules for each selector

To make this page look good on a laptop/desktop, put the contents of the site inside a container element. Set the `max-width` CSS style on this element and center the element using `margin: 0 auto;`.

Before beginning to code, remember that a good SWE will make these decisions before writing code.  So don't overlook this exercise in design and decisions. &#x20;
