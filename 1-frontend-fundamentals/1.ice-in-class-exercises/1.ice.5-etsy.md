# 1.ICE.5: Etsy

## Introduction

![](../../.gitbook/assets/etsy.jpg)

Recreate the website screenshot above. This exercise is only for mobile view, not desktop view. The screenshot has been modified from the original page for simplicity.

## Setup

Begin with this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp)

## Tips

Given the limited time for this exercise, begin by coding the top and bottom of the page before adding each middle section. Refer to the [cheatsheet](../1.5-basic-css/README.md#exercise-tips-cheatsheet) to make the page easier to code.

To improve aesthetics for desktop view, wrap site content in a container element with a `max-width` CSS property and centre the container element using `margin: 0 auto;`.

For mobile layouts we will need to add the viewport tag in the HTML `head` element. Read more about the `viewport` tag [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag).

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
/>
```
