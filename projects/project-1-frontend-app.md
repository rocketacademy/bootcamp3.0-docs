# Project 1: Frontend App

## Introduction

Build an app that solves a problem you have using HTML, React and CSS. We will not be able to persist data until Module 2, but there are still many useful apps we can build.

## Requirements

1. Build an app using HTML, React and CSS with Create React App
2. Deploy the app with GitHub Pages

## Project Management Suggestions

Rocket recommends the following project management strategies and tools for all projects.

### User Stories

Start with user stories. Who is our user and what is their [job to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)? Be as specific as possible. After we articulate user stories we can proceed to design our app.

Example user stories for Project 1:

* An interior designer wants to determine whether 2 or more colours match and what an optimal colour palette might be for given a base colour
* A daily commuter wishes to play Flappy Bird during his 30-minute commute
* A couple wishes to play a game of checkers against each other on their shared computer

Above user stories may not require persisting user data beyond the current session. From Project 2 onward we will learn how to persist user data for multiple users accessing our apps at multiple times on different devices.

### Wireframes

After user stories, create simple wireframes to visually describe how our users will accomplish their user stories with our app. Rocket recommends [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for user stories because it is a relatively simple tool widely used by designers in industry. Only include what is needed for the user stories, no more and no less.

[Here](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-wireframe/) is an introduction to wireframing with Figma. Rocket recommends only low-fidelity wireframes for our projects due to limited time. Below are example wireframes by Figma; we can add interactivity by navigating to the Prototype tab in the right sidebar and adding connections.

### Kanban Board

After user stories and wireframes, Rocket recommends using a [kanban board](https://blog.trello.com/kanban-data-nave) to track implementation progress. A kanban board is a progress-tracking board that contains broadly 3 lists of tasks: To Do, Doing and Done. Rocket recommends [Trello](https://trello.com) for its simplicity, and the [Trello Engineering Kanban Template](https://trello.com/templates/engineering/kanban-template-LGHXvZNL) for its relevance to SWE.

Each task on your board should take no more than 1 day to complete. If you think it will take longer than 1 day, break it down into smaller tasks. This will help you stay motivated and track progress more accurately. Move in-progress tasks to the Doing lists and completed tasks to Done.

### Polish

"Polish" your app so that it is presentable to the public. This can involve the following attributes.

1. Does the app run without bugs?
2. Are variable names concise and precise?
3. Do we have [JSDoc comments](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html#adding-documentation-comments-to-your-code) above functions and inline comments above code that could be confusing to others?
4. Is each function sufficiently small and modular?
5. Is the visual design clean?
   1. Muted colours
   2. Elements have padding
6. Is the page responsive? Does it look good on both mobile and desktop?

## Project Submission and Past Student Projects

Once done with your project, please submit it by adding it to the [Rocket Bootcamp Projects spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZ39naj5E6mNNkQ1akR\_FgeFO\_kM6aWCAr8zqrFOkt4/edit?usp=sharing) in your batch-specific sheet. Feel free to view past student projects in previous batches' sheets.
