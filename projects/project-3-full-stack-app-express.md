# Project 3: Full-Stack App (Express)

## Introduction

Build an app that solves a problem you have using React and Express. Feel free to also use any 3rd-party libraries, Firebase features, or other technologies. This project can be done individually or in a group.

## Requirements

### App

1. React App with CRA
2. Express API server that processes GET and POST requests
3. PostgreSQL DB to store data
4. Sequelize ORM to interface between API server and DB
5. At least 1 1-M and 1 M-M SQL relationship in DB schema
6. Seed data in DB seed migrations
7. JWT authentication for user login

### Other

1. Frontend deployed with provider of your choice (e.g. GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, Netlify)
2. Backend deployed with Heroku
3. Naming, casing and commenting [best practices](../general-reference/naming-casing-and-commenting-conventions.md)
4. Git commits for each feature with descriptive commit messages
5. App description in README with user stories and low-fidelity wireframes
6. Instructions in README to run app
