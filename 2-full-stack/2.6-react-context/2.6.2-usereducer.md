# 2.6.2: `useReducer`

## Introduction

`useReducer` is an alternative to `useState` that allows us to provide a function \(called a "reducer"\) that manipulates state in a pre-defined way. `useReducer` and the `reducer` function allow us to manipulate state in more complex ways. The `reducer` function is a helper function for state manipulation, and allows us to set new state based on the value of the previous state.

## Example

The following example comes from the official React `useReducer` documentation [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer).

We can call our `reducer` function via the `dispatch` method returned by `useReducer`, which wraps our `reducer` function and passes the relevant parameters to it. The 1st parameter passed to `dispatch` is the 2nd parameter passed to `reducer`, i.e. the `action` JS Object parameter.

```jsx
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## What's Next

We'll combine `useReducer` with `useContext`'s `Provider` higher-order component to create a global-state-setting function that is available without lifting functions.
