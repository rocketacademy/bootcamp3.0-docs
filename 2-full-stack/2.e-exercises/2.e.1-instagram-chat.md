# 2.E.1: Instagram Chat

## Learning Objectives

1. Install, import and use a 3rd-party library in React
2. Understand how to use Firebase Realtime Database
3. Understand how to structure chat data in a NoSQL JSON database
4. Practise reading documentation to apply a new technology

## Introduction

This is the first of multiple exercises culminating in an Instagram clone. We start with chat because it a common example and will allow us to warm up to network requests, promises and Firebase.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone the [Rocket Academy Instagram starter repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/instagram-bootcamp)
2. [Add Firebase to our project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)
   1. Rocket recommends following the text instructions and not the video because the video demonstrates creating a Firebase app from scratch, not with Rocket's starter repo that includes starter code from Create React App.
   2. Create a Firebase project and call it "Instagram"
      1. There is no need to enable Google Analytics for this project. Disable that option when creating a project to avoid creating a Google Analytics account.
   3. Register our app with our Firebase project
3. Set up Firebase Realtime Database in the repo as per the [official Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start)
