# 2.E.1: Instagram Chat

## Learning Objectives

1. Install, import and use a 3rd-party library in React
2. Understand how to use Firebase Realtime Database
3. Understand how to structure chat data in a NoSQL JSON database
4. Practise reading documentation to apply a new technology

## Introduction

This is the first of multiple exercises culminating in an Instagram clone. We start with chat because it a common example and will allow us to warm up to network requests, promises and Firebase.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone the [Rocket Academy Instagram starter repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/instagram-bootcamp)
   1. Run `npm i` to install packages in `package.json` after cloning
2. [Add Firebase to our project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)
   1. Rocket recommends following the text and not video instructions on the Firebase docs page because the video demonstrates creating a Firebase app from scratch, not with Rocket's starter repo that includes starter code from Create React App.
   2. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console and call it "Instagram"
      1. There is no need to enable Google Analytics for this project. Disable that option when creating a project to avoid creating a Google Analytics account.
   3. Register our app with our Firebase project
      1. We can call our app "Instagram"
      2. No need to set up Firebase Hosting for now
      3. No need to `npm install firebase` because Rocket has already installed it in `package.json`
      4. Replace the contents of the `firebaseConfig` object in `src/firebase.js` with our app's config details. We will retrieve the `databaseUrl` property after the next step.
3. Set up Firebase Realtime Database in the repo as per the [official Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start)
   1. Start from Create a Database; we just completed the prerequisite in the previous step
      1. When creating a database in the Firebase console, select the location nearest to you when prompted to choose "Realtime Database location"
      2. Select "Start in test mode" for security rules; we will set up more stringent security rules later after learning about authentication.
   2. Skip "Configure Realtime Database Rules" section in the docs; we will set up database rules after learning authentication.
   3. Initialise the Realtime Database JavaScript SDK
      1. Rocket has set up initialisation code in the starter repo in `src/firebase.js`
      2. Find your Realtime Database URL as per instructions in this section and paste it as the value of the `databaseURL` property in the `firebaseConfig` object in `src/firebase.js`. Your database URL should look something like `https://instagram-abc123-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app/`.
      3. Once we have added the database URL to `firebase.js`, we should be able to start using our database in React components that import the database from `firebase.js`. See how we import the database in `App.js` for an example.
