# 2.E.5: Weather App

## Learning Objectives

1. Know how to send an HTTP request and handle response data in a frontend app
2. Know how to send an AJAX request and load response data in a React app
3. Know how to read API documentation to use a new API

## Introduction

We will build a weather app that shows the latest weather forecast for a city that a user enters.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone the Rocket Academy Weather App Repo
2. [Create an Open Weather account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign\_up) to access Open Weather's free weather API. After confirming your email you will receive an API key to use to make API requests.

## Base: Show current weather for user-provided city

1. Create an input field where users can input the city they would like to check the weather for. Provide instructions on the page so users know to enter a city name in the input.
2. When a user inputs a city name, use [Open Weather's current weather data API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to retrieve the weather in that city and display it to the user. The app should update the weather when the user inputs a new city or submits the same city again.
   1. We will need to use [Open Weather's geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) to translate location names to coordinates before querying the current weather data API. You may find it helpful to chained promises with `.then` syntax.

**Making our API key public**

By making API requests to Open Weather directly from our frontend app, we are effectively making our Open Weather API public because all frontend code is visible to users. This is discouraged in production apps because hackers can use our Open Weather account to make requests for free. We will learn how to build backend servers to hide sensitive data such as API keys in Module 3.

## Comfortable: Show hourly and daily forecasts for coming days

In addition to the current weather, display [hourly forecast](https://openweathermap.org/api/hourly-forecast) and [daily forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast16) data to the user in tables.

## More Comfortable: Show forecast data in a graph

Render the forecast data in a graph instead of a table. You may find React chart libraries like [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) helpful.

## Submission

Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of Rocket's Weather App repo and share your PR link in your section Slack channel.

If you would like to deploy your app to the internet, follow Create React App GitHub Pages [deployment instructions here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
