# üè≠ 2: Full Stack

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn how the internet works
2. Learn how to use React with Firebase to build apps that persist data and authenticate users
3. Learn how to use React Hooks, React Router, and AJAX requests to build modern React apps with rich functionality and connectivity to 3rd-party APIs
4. Become more confident in reading documentation to learn new technologies

## Introduction

Welcome to full-stack engineering where apps have both a frontend and backend. We will strengthen our foundation in React by learning advanced React techniques such as Hooks, React Router and AJAX requests in React. We will learn to use a backend service Firebase to persist data from our apps and authenticate our users. Module 2 culminates in Project 2 where we will build a fully-featured app that can mimic virtually any app on the market today.
