# 7.7.1: AJAX Requests from Components

## Introduction

When our app starts we are getting a list of items from the database. Next we'll send a POST request to the server to record a sale.

A new branch of the ecommerce app repo has been created for this functionality: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/tree/orders](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/tree/orders)

Check out the full diff of the app here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that using AJAX means we don't need to encapsulate our input elements in HTML form elements. Form elements will cause our page to refresh on submit, which may not be what we want.
{% endhint %}

## Models

Two new tables have been added to the app, Order and OrderItem: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders?expand=1\#diff-dbb9ac5aa07bd02d31bee46df2f2710c29b54193ab29aa1274c6e6afd9215c8dR28](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders?expand=1#diff-dbb9ac5aa07bd02d31bee46df2f2710c29b54193ab29aa1274c6e6afd9215c8dR28)

## Controllers

A new controller that accepts the POST request has been created. It creates the order and records all the items in the order: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders?expand=1\#diff-0e4202fb0b6b446b3b4affc9186952c3794c9bb51764ffe601bf520a9d9788f3R11](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders?expand=1#diff-0e4202fb0b6b446b3b4affc9186952c3794c9bb51764ffe601bf520a9d9788f3R11)

## Cart Component

A button has been added to the Cart component that "checks out" the user. This button makes the request to check out. After the request response has come back, we empty the cart and display a message: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders?expand=1\#diff-5b736dbb0110ddcf3dd6a76d9abaa8d1ad9311a4516693a5d7c948053aa9aad1R37](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp/compare/orders?expand=1#diff-5b736dbb0110ddcf3dd6a76d9abaa8d1ad9311a4516693a5d7c948053aa9aad1R37)
