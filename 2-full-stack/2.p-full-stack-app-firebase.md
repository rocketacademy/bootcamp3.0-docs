# 2.P: Full-Stack App (Firebase)

## Introduction

Build an app in a group of 2 or 3 that solves a problem you have using React and Firebase. Feel free to use any 3rd-party libraries and Firebase features beyond the ones we have learnt.

## Requirements

### App

1. React app with Create React App
2. Data storage with Firebase Realtime Database or Firebase Firestore
3. File upload with Firebase Storage
4. Authentication with Firebase Authentication
5. App routing with React Router
6. 1 or more requests to an external API using Axios or Fetch libraries
7. At least 2 levels of components, e.g. `App` component and 1 or more child components at least 1 level below it
8. [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts), [MUI](https://mui.com/core/) or another component UI or CSS framework
9. Responsive layout that is user-friendly on mobile and desktop views

### Other

1. 2 or 3 group members each contributing at least 1 feature
2. Deployment with Firebase Hosting
3. Naming, casing and commenting [best practices](../general-reference/naming-casing-and-commenting-conventions.md)
4. Git commits for each feature with descriptive commit messages
5. App description in README with user stories and low-fidelity wireframes
6. Instructions in README to run app

## Ideas

As before, try to find an idea that solves a problem you have. Now that we can persist data with Firebase and send HTTP requests to arbitrary APIs, there is virtually no limit to the type of app we can build. Be realistic about the scope of your project: 1 polished feature that solves a common or important problem is more valuable than many scrappy features of lower value.

While brainstorming ideas, visualise how you might present the project to a prospective employer. Is this project impressive because it solves an unaddressed problem? Because it is technically well-done? Because of the thoughtfulness of its UX?

Some APIs and libraries we can consider:

1. [Data.gov.sg real-time APIs](https://data.gov.sg/developer)
2. [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision)
3. [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/react-map)

## Timeline

You will have roughly 8 course days to complete this project. We will observe the following timeline to keep us on track.

## Project Management Suggestions

In addition to user story, wireframe and kanban board suggestions [shared during Project 1](project-1-frontend-app.md#project-management-suggestions), now that we have a database (DB), Rocket recommends we plan the DB schema before starting. Our DB schema will change during app development, but planning ahead can reduce the number of changes. Rocket recommends we revise the [Firebase Realtime Database guide on structuring data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data) before starting, and reviewing the [Firebase Firestore guide on structuring data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/structure-data) if we plan to use Firestore.

## How to code in a group

### General strategy

1. Have 1 person create a GitHub repo and invite other team members as collaborators
2. For each task in the kanban board, create a new feature branch from `main`. Name the branch after the task. When the task is done, push the feature branch to GitHub, create a pull request (PR) and merge the code into `main` from the PR in GitHub.

### How to pull and merge latest changes in `main` to feature branch

Team members will merge code to `main` regularly and we will want to incorporate those changes in our feature branch to ensure compatibility with `main`. Rocket recommends this operation before merging to `main` to test merge results on feature branch instead of `main`.

1. Save & commit all changes on the current (non-`main`) feature branch. Pull latest changes to `main` with `git pull origin main`.
2. Merge `main` to feature branch with `git merge main` while on feature branch
3. Resolve any conflicts on feature branch. Follow instructions in console, using `git status` to see what steps are needed.

### How to merge latest changes from feature branch to `main`

After committing changes and verifying our feature branch is compatible with `main`, we will merge our changes to `main` for our teammates to use.

1. Push feature branch to GitHub with `git push`, then create a PR to merge feature branch with `main` on GitHub.
2. After merging PR in GitHub, run `git pull origin main` to get latest `main` branch changes from GitHub.
3. Delete feature branch locally with `git branch -d <FEATURE-BRANCH-NAME>`
4. Delete feature branch on GitHub with `git push origin --delete <FEATURE-BRANCH-NAME>`

### How to avoid merge conflicts

Merge conflicts happen when Git is unsure how to merge 2 versions of a file. To resolve a merge conflict, use `git status` to find which files have conflicts, resolve the conflicts in each file by editing it to be what it should be, and run `git commit` to complete the merge. We can reduce the chance of merge conflicts by communicating often with our team and merging latest changes from `main` to our feature branch regularly.

## Setup

Start by forking Rocket's [Bootcamp Project 2 repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/project2-bootcamp) that contains an empty CRA app. This will make it easier for SLs to review your code via pull requests.

## Deployment

Rocket recommends [deploying to Firebase Hosting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#firebase) as per Create React App official docs because Firebase Hosting allows for client-side routing by React Router, unlike GitHub Pages.

## Submission

1. Submit a pull request to Rocket's Project 2 repo
2. Add your Project 2 repo link to the [Rocket Bootcamp Projects spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZ39naj5E6mNNkQ1akR\_FgeFO\_kM6aWCAr8zqrFOkt4/edit?usp=sharing) in your batch-specific sheet. Feel free to review past student projects in previous batches' sheets.

## General Tips

1. Code the foundation of the app together before splitting up to code individual features. This will reduce merge conflicts and help everyone gain a common understanding of how the app should work.
2. Implement the primary user story first. What are users coming to your app to do? Ensure they are able to accomplish that before adding authentication and nice-to-have features.
