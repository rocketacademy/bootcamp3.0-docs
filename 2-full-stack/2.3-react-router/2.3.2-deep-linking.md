# 2.4.2: Deep Linking

Note that the way we setup React Router in our shopping app allowed us to change the URL of the page to the currently selected item: [http://localhost:3001/items/1](http://localhost:3001/items/1) Without any further work, this page does not error when the user initializes the React app with this path, however, it doesn't work with the correct behaviour. This is because the list of all items has not been loaded into the state of the app \(The user hasn't clicked the button yet\).

See the branch here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/tree/rr-deep-links](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/tree/rr-deep-links)

We can fix this by adding all the necessary logic to the app:

```text
// If the user's path is detected by React Router so that
it renders the ItemDetail component

// Check to see if the item is empty.

// If the item is empty, use the current path to set the selected item.
```

```jsx
// use a hook to get the item id
// not this only works inside the Router child component
// it will not work in App where we declare React Router
let { id } = useParams();
```

```jsx
// when ItemDetail initializes, check to see if item is set.
// If it's not, set it from the current id param
useEffect(() => {
  if (!item) {
    // we have access to the current param inside of ItemDetail
    // pass it back to App so that the index can be set
    onDeepLink(id);
  }
}, []);
```
