# 1.2.3: Selecting HTML Elements

## Introduction

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/eLYFvfY1lKU" caption="" %}

Using the DOM we can create a JS representation of an element that's on the screen.

For example, if the following element existed in our HTML...

```html
<p id="wow">cool :)</p>
```

... we could use DOM code to "grab" the element and obtain a JS representation it. We can then perform DOM manipulation on this JS representation.

```javascript
const wowParagraph = document.querySelector("#wow");
```

## Grab Any Element

To review how element selection works, see the examples on the following page. We can get references to any element in the DOM. [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp)
