# 1: Frontend

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to build web pages and applications with HTML, CSS and React
2. Learn how to use and architect React Components, Props and State
3. Learn how to customise UI with CSS
4. Learn how to use React UI frameworks such as React Bootstrap and Material UI

## Introduction

Welcome to frontend engineering. We will develop modern frontend web applications using HTML, CSS, JS and React. All web applications are built with HTML, CSS and JS, and React has been the most popular web framework for past years. Despite building web applications, concepts we will learn such as components, state and layout will also apply to mobile and desktop applications. Module 1 culminates in Project 1, where we will build an app of our choice using these frontend technologies.
