# 1.ICE.6: Portfolio Page

## Introduction

This is a summation of the Flexbox and responsive layout material so far. We'll make a fully-responsive page using Flexbox and media queries, in addition to other basic styles such as display and margin.

## Instructions

1. Begin with the starter code repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp).
2. Use Flexbox and media queries to achieve the responsive behaviour in the [sample page](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG).
3. Begin with the mobile layout first and use media queries to apply layout styles needed for the larger layout sizes.

## Tips

For mobile layouts we will need to add the viewport tag in the HTML `head` element. Read more about the `viewport` tag [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag).

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
/>
```
