# 7.ICE.4: Guess the Word

Create a game of guess the word.

## Setup

Begin with the [base react repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp)

## Base

Work on the game in the following order:

### Part 1

Hardcode a secret word to guess: banana.

Create a controlled form in which the user can only type one letter as a guess.

Create a hard-coded array of letters that represents the word.

Create a state variable. The initial value of this variable is an array which is the same length as the secret word array, but with only \_ in the array.

```javascript
const secretWord = ['b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a'];

// the array begins with only _
const [guessedLetters, setGuessedLetters] = useState([
  '_',
  '_',
  '_',
  '_',
  '_',
  '_',
]);
```

If the user guesses correctly, add the letter to the correctly guessed letters array.

Display the guessed letters' positions on the screen using the array.

### Part 2

For each wrong guess the program adds to the figure: \(凸 ಠ 益 ಠ\)凸

The player can only guess wrong 7 times before the game ends. \(the number of characters in the figure\)

Note: code only in the `App` component. No need to make child components of `App`.

## Comfortable

### Reset Game

When the user loses create a button on screen that will start a new game.
