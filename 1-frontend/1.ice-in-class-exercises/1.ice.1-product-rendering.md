# 7.ICE.1: Product Rendering

## Introduction

Render an array of objects using JSX.

## Setup

1. Begin with the base Webpack repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp.git](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp.git)
2. Follow the instructions in [Module 1.2.1: JSX](../1.2.1-jsx/#setup) to set up Webpack for React.
3. Copy the contents of [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketacademy/bootcamp-docs/master/fixture-data/products.json) into `index.jsx`. Conversely, you can also make a module for this data if you want.
   1. This means copying the data and pasting it into a new `data.json` file
   2. In your `index.jsx` file, import the data with `import data from './data.json'`

## Base

Render the data in the array onto the screen. The HTML should look like this:\
(R*emember to add the 'key' attribute for your mapped element!)*

```markup
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>id: 1</p>
    <p>name: Car</p>
    <p>description: The Apollotech B340 is an affordable wireless mouse with reliable connectivity, 12 months battery life and modern design</p>

  </li>
  [...]
</ul>
```

## Comfortable

1. Install [Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) and format the dates to [time from now.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/)
2. Use CSS so that the background colour of the items alternate between white and grey.
