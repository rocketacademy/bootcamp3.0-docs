# 1.ICE.7: Bootstrap Columns

## Introduction

Complete these Bootstrap layout exercises to familiarise yourself with Bootstrap layout.

## Setup

1. Clone [Rocket's Bootstrap starter code](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basic-bootstrap-bootcamp.git)
2. Refer to the Bootstrap documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/). We should be able to use Bootstrap CSS classes for everything, except for Mobile Collapse, where we may need to use custom CSS classes to change background colours.

## Base Columns

1. Create a set of 3 Bootstrap columns.
2. Put the 3 paragraphs of text [here](https://pastebin.com/pQnE44HB) from [cat ipsum](http://www.catipsum.com/index.php) into the 3 columns respectively.

## Mobile Collapse

1. Add custom CSS classes with different background colours to each column so that each column is more recognisable.
2. Update column proportions such that when the screen is tablet-size or larger, the centre column should be twice as large as the others.
3. Add mobile styling to the columns. In mobile view the columns should stack vertically.

## Full Responsive

1. Mobile view: columns stack vertically, same as previous exercise.
2. Tablet view: 1st and 2nd columns stack vertically and take up half width. 3rd column takes up other half.
3. Desktop view: Render columns differently from mobile and tablet views.
