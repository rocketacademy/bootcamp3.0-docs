## Introduction

[React](https://reactjs.org) is a frontend framework and library that allows us to create custom, nest-able UI elements with a combination of HTML and JavaScript syntax (JSX). React's HTML-like structure makes it easy to visualise, and its integrated JS makes it easy to render dynamic data. Alternative but less popular frontend libraries include [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Angular](https://angularjs.org).&#x20;

At Rocket we will use a React app-builder library [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) to build React apps. Browsers do not read React code (they read HTML, CSS and JS, not JSX), and we need a tool called Webpack to translate React to HTML, CSS and JS. Webpack is built into Create React App.
