# 1.POCE.2: High Card DOM

## Introduction

Many of us will have seen High Card from Coding Basics. For a refresher on High Card, see the Coding Basics page [here](https://codingbasics.rocketacademy.co/modules/1-data-types-structures-and-manipulations/1.4-objects). In this module we will implement High Card from scratch, adding DOM elements to make the game more visual and interactive.

## Basic High Card

The following is a wireframe of our High Card UI. Game info will be in a big box on top, and there will be 2 buttons below for Players 1 and 2 to draw cards respectively.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/bootcamp_-_wireframes_-_basic_dice_g (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

The following is an adaptation of our [code from Coding Basics](https://codingbasics.rocketacademy.co/modules/1-data-types-structures-and-manipulations/1.4-objects), where we add UI elements with DOM manipulation and event listeners to trigger game logic and UI updates based on user actions. The logic of this first version of High Card is the same as the original, non-DOM game.

```javascript
// Get a random index ranging from 0 (inclusive) to max (exclusive).
const getRandomIndex = (max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * max);

// Shuffle an array of cards
const shuffleCards = (cards) => {
  // Loop over the card deck array once
  for (let currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < cards.length; currentIndex += 1) {
    // Select a random index in the deck
    const randomIndex = getRandomIndex(cards.length);
    // Select the card that corresponds to randomIndex
    const randomCard = cards[randomIndex];
    // Select the card that corresponds to currentIndex
    const currentCard = cards[currentIndex];
    // Swap positions of randomCard and currentCard in the deck
    cards[currentIndex] = randomCard;
    cards[randomIndex] = currentCard;
  }
  // Return the shuffled deck
  return cards;
};

const makeDeck = () => {
  // Initialise an empty deck array
  const newDeck = [];
  // Initialise an array of the 4 suits in our deck. We will loop over this array.
  const suits = ["hearts", "diamonds", "clubs", "spades"];

  // Loop over the suits array
  for (let suitIndex = 0; suitIndex < suits.length; suitIndex += 1) {
    // Store the current suit in a variable
    const currentSuit = suits[suitIndex];

    // Loop from 1 to 13 to create all cards for a given suit
    // Notice rankCounter starts at 1 and not 0, and ends at 13 and not 12.
    // This is an example of a loop without an array.
    for (let rankCounter = 1; rankCounter <= 13; rankCounter += 1) {
      // By default, the card name is the same as rankCounter
      let cardName = `${rankCounter}`;

      // If rank is 1, 11, 12, or 13, set cardName to the ace or face card's name
      if (cardName === "1") {
        cardName = "ace";
      } else if (cardName === "11") {
        cardName = "jack";
      } else if (cardName === "12") {
        cardName = "queen";
      } else if (cardName === "13") {
        cardName = "king";
      }

      // Create a new card with the current name, suit, and rank
      const card = {
        name: cardName,
        suit: currentSuit,
        rank: rankCounter,
      };

      // Add the new card to the deck
      newDeck.push(card);
    }
  }

  // Return the completed card deck
  return newDeck;
};

const deck = shuffleCards(makeDeck());

// Player 1 starts first
let playersTurn = 1;

// Use let for player1Card object because player1Card will be reassigned
let player1Card;

// create two buttons
const player1Button = document.createElement("button");
player1Button.innerText = "Player 1 Draw";
document.body.appendChild(player1Button);

const player2Button = document.createElement("button");
player2Button.innerText = "Player 2 Draw";
document.body.appendChild(player2Button);

// Create game info div as global value
// fill game info div with starting instructions
const gameInfo = document.createElement("div");
gameInfo.innerText = "Its player 1 turn. Click to draw a card!";
document.body.appendChild(gameInfo);

// Create a helper function for output to abstract complexity
// of DOM manipulation away from game logic
const output = (message) => {
  gameInfo.innerText = message;
};

// Add an event listener on player 1's button to draw card and switch
// to player 2's turn
player1Button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (playersTurn === 1) {
    player1Card = deck.pop();
    playersTurn = 2;
  }
});

// Add event listener on player 2's button to draw card and determine winner
// Switch back to player 1's turn to repeat game
player2Button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (playersTurn === 2) {
    const player2Card = deck.pop();
    playersTurn = 1;

    if (player1Card.rank > player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 1 wins");
    } else if (player1Card.rank < player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 2 wins");
    } else {
      output("tie");
    }
  }
});
```

## Refactoring

The above is a lot of code. Let's organise it into sections within our JS file. Soon we'll learn how to split sections of code into multiple files.

### Global Setup

The following are global variables that store data or DOM elements that need to be accessible across our game.

```javascript
const deck = shuffleCards(makeDeck());

let playersTurn = 1; // matches with starting instructions
let player1Card;

const player1Button = document.createElement("button");

const player2Button = document.createElement("button");

const gameInfo = document.createElement("div");
```

### Helper Functions

The following are helper functions that enable specific game logic.

```javascript
// Get a random index ranging from 0 (inclusive) to max (exclusive).
const getRandomIndex = (max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * max);

// Shuffle an array of cards
const shuffleCards = (cards) => {
  // Loop over the card deck array once
  for (let currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < cards.length; currentIndex += 1) {
    // Select a random index in the deck
    const randomIndex = getRandomIndex(cards.length);
    // Select the card that corresponds to randomIndex
    const randomCard = cards[randomIndex];
    // Select the card that corresponds to currentIndex
    const currentCard = cards[currentIndex];
    // Swap positions of randomCard and currentCard in the deck
    cards[currentIndex] = randomCard;
    cards[randomIndex] = currentCard;
  }
  // Return the shuffled deck
  return cards;
};

const makeDeck = () => {
  // Initialise an empty deck array
  const newDeck = [];
  // Initialise an array of the 4 suits in our deck. We will loop over this array.
  const suits = ["hearts", "diamonds", "clubs", "spades"];

  // Loop over the suits array
  for (let suitIndex = 0; suitIndex < suits.length; suitIndex += 1) {
    // Store the current suit in a variable
    const currentSuit = suits[suitIndex];

    // Loop from 1 to 13 to create all cards for a given suit
    // Notice rankCounter starts at 1 and not 0, and ends at 13 and not 12.
    // This is an example of a loop without an array.
    for (let rankCounter = 1; rankCounter <= 13; rankCounter += 1) {
      // By default, the card name is the same as rankCounter
      let cardName = `${rankCounter}`;

      // If rank is 1, 11, 12, or 13, set cardName to the ace or face card's name
      if (cardName === "1") {
        cardName = "ace";
      } else if (cardName === "11") {
        cardName = "jack";
      } else if (cardName === "12") {
        cardName = "queen";
      } else if (cardName === "13") {
        cardName = "king";
      }

      // Create a new card with the current name, suit, and rank
      const card = {
        name: cardName,
        suit: currentSuit,
        rank: rankCounter,
      };

      // Add the new card to the deck
      newDeck.push(card);
    }
  }

  // Return the completed card deck
  return newDeck;
};

// Create a helper function for output to abstract complexity
// of DOM manipulation away from game logic
const output = (message) => {
  gameInfo.innerText = message;
};
```

### Player Action Callbacks

The following are callbacks that our logic triggers when Players 1 and 2 click on their respective buttons.

```javascript
const player1Click = () => {
  if (playersTurn === 1) {
    player1Card = deck.pop();
    playersTurn = 2;
  }
};

const player2Click = () => {
  if (playersTurn === 2) {
    const player2Card = deck.pop();
    playersTurn = 1;

    if (player1Card.rank > player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 1 wins");
    } else if (player1Card.rank < player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 2 wins");
    } else {
      output("tie");
    }
  }
};
```

### Game Initialisation

We can now centralise our game initialisation into a single function called `initGame`.

```javascript
const initGame = () => {
  // initialize button functionality
  player1Button.innerText = "Player 1 Draw";
  document.body.appendChild(player1Button);

  player2Button.innerText = "Player 2 Draw";
  document.body.appendChild(player2Button);

  player1Button.addEventListener("click", player1Click);
  player2Button.addEventListener("click", player2Click);

  // fill game info div with starting instructions
  gameInfo.innerText = "Its player 1 turn. Click to draw a card!";
  document.body.appendChild(gameInfo);
};
```

## High Card with More Visual Output

Now let's display more complex HTML elements in our Game Info box instead of just text. This will require more advanced DOM manipulation because it involves nested elements, e.g. cards within the game info box, various properties within each card.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/bootcamp_-_wireframes_-_basic_high_c (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

### DOM Manipulation Strategies

When creating visual DOM element output with JS we'll use the following strategies to help us.

1. Hard-code HTML first to determine what structure we need, before coding JS for those elements
2. Apply CSS styles with CSS classes defined in a separate CSS file, and avoid applying CSS styles to DOM elements inline. This helps us keep our CSS organised and manageable.
3. Try to keep game logic as simple as possible by creating helper functions for creation or manipulation of each DOM element. This allows us to separate more "operational code" (creating elements, adding elements to the DOM, adding CSS classes to elements) from the higher-level logic (e.g. `createGameInfoBox`, `createPlayerButton`, `createCard`, `revealCard`). Try to avoid mixing DOM manipulation code with higher-level logic.

### Create Sample Element with HTML

Before writing DOM manipulation code in JS, we can create a sample element with HTML to verify what we want our JS code to achieve. The following might be the HTML we want for a single card.

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="name red">3</div>
  <div class="suit">♥️</div>
</div>
```

The CSS for the card elements might be the following.

```css
.card {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: grey;
  width: 50px;
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 8px;
  display: inline-block;
}

.suit {
  margin: 5px;
  font-size: 20px;
}

.name {
  margin: 5px;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

.red {
  color: red;
}
```

Using the above HTML and CSS we can verify what we hope to achieve with our JS DOM manipulation by rendering a hard-coded element in our browser.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-08-at-2.40.35-pm-2-.png)

We might also want to wrap our cards in a container in which our JS can add these cards programatically. The resulting HTML might look like the following.

```html
<div class="card-container">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="name red">3</div>
    <div class="suit">♥️</div>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="name red">4</div>
    <div class="suit">♥️</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Translate HTML to JS DOM Manipulation

The JS to build the card element might look like the following. Note that we are still using hard-coded values, and we will parameterise those values below.

```javascript
const suit = document.createElement("div");
suit.classList.add("suit");
suit.innerText = "♥️";

const name = document.createElement("div");
name.classList.add("name", "red");
name.innerText = "3";

const card = document.createElement("div");
card.classList.add("card");

card.appendChild(name);
card.appendChild(suit);
```

We will want to abstract this into a function to re-use for multiple cards, such as the following.

```javascript
const makeCard = () => {
  const suit = document.createElement("div");
  suit.classList.add("suit");
  suit.innerText = "♥️";

  const name = document.createElement("div");
  name.classList.add("name", "red");
  name.innerText = "3";

  const card = document.createElement("div");
  card.classList.add("card");

  card.appendChild(name);
  card.appendChild(suit);
};
```

### Parameterise Card Attributes

We will now update `makeCard` to accept a parameter containing all the relevant attributes for a single card. We will include visual attributes in addition to the attributes we used for cards in Coding Basics (name, suit, rank).

One of the new visual attributes is colour, representing the colour of the card's suit. To get the correct colour for each card, we could determine it based on the card's suit. For this example, we will encode the colour directly into the card metadata object along with name, suit, rank, and other metadata.

We will store metadata needed to display our card in a `cardInfo` object, including `suitSymbol`, `displayName`, and `colour`. `suitSymbol` is the symbol of the card's suit. `displayName` is the short-form display name of the card's name. `colour` is the colour of the card's suit. We use `displayName` because our element has no room for full names of face cards like "queen".

```javascript
const cardInfo = {
  suitSymbol: "♦️",
  suit: "diamond",
  name: "queen",
  displayName: "Q",
  colour: "red",
  rank: 12,
};
```

Now we can pass and use the `cardInfo` attributes in our `createCard` function.

```javascript
const createCard = (cardInfo) => {
  const suit = document.createElement("div");
  suit.classList.add("suit");
  suit.innerText = cardInfo.suitSymbol;

  const name = document.createElement("div");
  name.classList.add("name", cardInfo.colour);
  name.innerText = "3";

  const card = document.createElement("div");
  card.classList.add("card");

  card.appendChild(name);
  card.appendChild(suit);

  return card;
};
```

### Update Deck Creation to Include Visual Card Attributes

How would we alter `createDeck` to include the new visual attributes for each card's metadata?

### Integrate Card Element Generation with Game Logic

Add the `cardContainer` DOM element as a global variable.

```javascript
let cardContainer;
```

Initialise `cardContainer` as a `div` with CSS class `card-container`, and add it to the document body. Add this logic to the `initGame` function.

```javascript
cardContainer = document.createElement("div");
cardContainer.classList.add("card-container");
document.body.appendChild(cardContainer);
```

Update Player 1 and 2 button callback functions to create and render the relevant elements in `cardContainer`.

```javascript
const player1Click = () => {
  if (playersTurn === 1) {
    // Pop player 1's card metadata from the deck
    player1Card = deck.pop();

    // Create card element from card metadata
    const cardElement = createCard(player1Card);
    // Empty cardContainer in case this is not the 1st round of gameplay
    cardContainer.innerHTML = "";
    // Append the card element to the card container
    cardContainer.appendChild(cardElement);

    // Switch to player 2's turn
    playersTurn = 2;
  }
};

const player2Click = () => {
  if (playersTurn === 2) {
    // Pop player 2's card metadata from the deck
    const player2Card = deck.pop();

    // Create card element from card metadata
    const cardElement = createCard(player2Card);
    // Append card element to card container
    cardContainer.appendChild(cardElement);

    // Switch to player 1's turn
    playersTurn = 1;

    // Determine and output winner
    if (player1Card.rank > player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 1 wins");
    } else if (player1Card.rank < player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 2 wins");
    } else {
      output("tie");
    }
  }
};
```

## Base

Fork and clone the [SWE Bootcamp High Card repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/high-card-bootcamp) and use code from High Card above to construct a working High Card game. Submit a pull request once done.

Don't forget to [run npm install in the starter code directory.](../logistics/required-hardware-and-software.md#eslint-npm-configuration-libraries)

## Comfortable

### High / Low Card

Players can draw multiple cards each. The winner is the player with the greatest difference in rank between highest and lowest cards in his hand.

Use CSS to display each players' cards in a row.

## More Comfortable

### Card Display

Arrange cards so highest and lowest cards in each hand are displayed next to each other in the row.

### Number of Cards

Create a text input and submit button for players to indicate how many cards should be drawn per player before they play the game. The players can draw in any order until they have each drawn the designated number of cards. Display the winner after the players draw the final card.

# React High Card

## Introduction

Implement a 2-player High Card game using React. In each round of High Card each player draws 1 card from the deck and the player with the highest card wins.

## Setup

1. Begin with [Rocket's React Express Base repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp)
2. Copy `getRandomIndex`, `shuffleCards` and `makeDeck` functions from [Module 1.3: High Card DOM](../../1-frontend-basics/1.3-high-card-dom.md) and paste them into `src/App.jsx` below the import statements
3. Add `useState` to imports like in this example so we can use `useState` in the `App` component
4. Copy the `App` component starter code below into `App.jsx`. The code initialises the card deck state array variable and deals cards into player hands.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  // Set the default value of the deck
  const [cardDeck, setCardDeck] = useState(shuffleCards(makeDeck()));

  // Set the default player hand as empty
  const [playerHand, setPlayerHand] = useState([]);

  // Deal 2 cards into the player's hand and update the deck
  const dealCards = () => {
    const hand = [cardDeck.pop(), cardDeck.pop()];
    setPlayerHand(hand);
    setCardDeck([...cardDeck]);
  };

  // Render cards in the player hand
  // Note that when this renders the first time and the hand is
  // empty, it does not require a special condition.
  const handElems = playerHand.map(({ name, suit }) => (
    <div>
      {name}
      {suit}
    </div>
  ));

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Cards:</h3>
        {handElems}
      </div>
      <p>
        <button onClick={dealCards}>Deal</button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Base

Create a game of High Card by comparing the 2 cards drawn from the deck and determining a winner.

## Comfortable

1. Update the game to add a Play Hand button. The user can continue to deal cards to themselves with the Deal button.
2. When the user clicks the Play Hand button the computer is dealt the same amount of cards in the user's hand, and the player with the highest card in both hands wins.
3. The game ends when the deck is out of cards. When the deck is out of cards, reset the game to the starting values.

## More Comfortable

Update a scoreboard when the deck runs out of cards. The player who had more winning hands gets 1 point.
