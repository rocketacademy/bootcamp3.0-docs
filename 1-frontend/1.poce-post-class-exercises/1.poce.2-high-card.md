# 1.POCE.3: High Card

## Learning Objectives

1. How to use Create React App to create a new React app
2. Solidify knowledge of HTML, CSS and React by using it to build a standalone React app
3. How to deploy a React app to the internet

## Introduction

High Card is a turn-based game between 2 or more players where each player draws a card and the player with the highest card wins that round. The overall winner is the player that has won the most rounds when the deck runs out of cards. We will implement High Card with React.

## Starter Code

We will start with a [blank Rocket-themed Create React App repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/high-card-bootcamp) and add code to create High Card.&#x20;



1. Copy the `App` component starter code below into `App.jsx`. The code initialises the card deck state array variable and deals cards into player hands.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  // Set the default value of the deck
  const [cardDeck, setCardDeck] = useState(shuffleCards(makeDeck()));

  // Set the default player hand as empty
  const [playerHand, setPlayerHand] = useState([]);

  // Deal 2 cards into the player's hand and update the deck
  const dealCards = () => {
    const hand = [cardDeck.pop(), cardDeck.pop()];
    setPlayerHand(hand);
    setCardDeck([...cardDeck]);
  };

  // Render cards in the player hand
  // Note that when this renders the first time and the hand is
  // empty, it does not require a special condition.
  const handElems = playerHand.map(({ name, suit }) => (
    <div>
      {name}
      {suit}
    </div>
  ));

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Cards:</h3>
        {handElems}
      </div>
      <p>
        <button onClick={dealCards}>Deal</button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```



The following is an adaptation of our code from Coding Basics, where we add UI elements with React and event listeners to trigger game logic and UI updates based on user actions.

```javascript
// Get a random index ranging from 0 (inclusive) to max (exclusive).
const getRandomIndex = (max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * max);

// Shuffle an array of cards
const shuffleCards = (cards) => {
  // Loop over the card deck array once
  for (let currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < cards.length; currentIndex += 1) {
    // Select a random index in the deck
    const randomIndex = getRandomIndex(cards.length);
    // Select the card that corresponds to randomIndex
    const randomCard = cards[randomIndex];
    // Select the card that corresponds to currentIndex
    const currentCard = cards[currentIndex];
    // Swap positions of randomCard and currentCard in the deck
    cards[currentIndex] = randomCard;
    cards[randomIndex] = currentCard;
  }
  // Return the shuffled deck
  return cards;
};

const makeDeck = () => {
  // Initialise an empty deck array
  const newDeck = [];
  // Initialise an array of the 4 suits in our deck. We will loop over this array.
  const suits = ["hearts", "diamonds", "clubs", "spades"];

  // Loop over the suits array
  for (let suitIndex = 0; suitIndex < suits.length; suitIndex += 1) {
    // Store the current suit in a variable
    const currentSuit = suits[suitIndex];

    // Loop from 1 to 13 to create all cards for a given suit
    // Notice rankCounter starts at 1 and not 0, and ends at 13 and not 12.
    // This is an example of a loop without an array.
    for (let rankCounter = 1; rankCounter <= 13; rankCounter += 1) {
      // By default, the card name is the same as rankCounter
      let cardName = `${rankCounter}`;

      // If rank is 1, 11, 12, or 13, set cardName to the ace or face card's name
      if (cardName === "1") {
        cardName = "ace";
      } else if (cardName === "11") {
        cardName = "jack";
      } else if (cardName === "12") {
        cardName = "queen";
      } else if (cardName === "13") {
        cardName = "king";
      }

      // Create a new card with the current name, suit, and rank
      const card = {
        name: cardName,
        suit: currentSuit,
        rank: rankCounter,
      };

      // Add the new card to the deck
      newDeck.push(card);
    }
  }

  // Return the completed card deck
  return newDeck;
};

const deck = shuffleCards(makeDeck());

// Player 1 starts first
let playersTurn = 1;

// Use let for player1Card object because player1Card will be reassigned
let player1Card;

// create two buttons
const player1Button = document.createElement("button");
player1Button.innerText = "Player 1 Draw";
document.body.appendChild(player1Button);

const player2Button = document.createElement("button");
player2Button.innerText = "Player 2 Draw";
document.body.appendChild(player2Button);

// Create game info div as global value
// fill game info div with starting instructions
const gameInfo = document.createElement("div");
gameInfo.innerText = "Its player 1 turn. Click to draw a card!";
document.body.appendChild(gameInfo);

// Create a helper function for output to abstract complexity
// of DOM manipulation away from game logic
const output = (message) => {
  gameInfo.innerText = message;
};

// Add an event listener on player 1's button to draw card and switch
// to player 2's turn
player1Button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (playersTurn === 1) {
    player1Card = deck.pop();
    playersTurn = 2;
  }
});

// Add event listener on player 2's button to draw card and determine winner
// Switch back to player 1's turn to repeat game
player2Button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (playersTurn === 2) {
    const player2Card = deck.pop();
    playersTurn = 1;

    if (player1Card.rank > player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 1 wins");
    } else if (player1Card.rank < player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 2 wins");
    } else {
      output("tie");
    }
  }
});
```

### High Card with More Visual Output

Now let's display more complex HTML elements in our Game Info box instead of just text. This will require more advanced DOM manipulation because it involves nested elements, e.g. cards within the game info box, various properties within each card.

```javascript
const player1Click = () => {
  if (playersTurn === 1) {
    // Pop player 1's card metadata from the deck
    player1Card = deck.pop();

    // Create card element from card metadata
    const cardElement = createCard(player1Card);
    // Empty cardContainer in case this is not the 1st round of gameplay
    cardContainer.innerHTML = "";
    // Append the card element to the card container
    cardContainer.appendChild(cardElement);

    // Switch to player 2's turn
    playersTurn = 2;
  }
};

const player2Click = () => {
  if (playersTurn === 2) {
    // Pop player 2's card metadata from the deck
    const player2Card = deck.pop();

    // Create card element from card metadata
    const cardElement = createCard(player2Card);
    // Append card element to card container
    cardContainer.appendChild(cardElement);

    // Switch to player 1's turn
    playersTurn = 1;

    // Determine and output winner
    if (player1Card.rank > player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 1 wins");
    } else if (player1Card.rank < player2Card.rank) {
      output("player 2 wins");
    } else {
      output("tie");
    }
  }
};
```

## Base

Fork and clone the [Coding Bootcamp High Card repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/high-card-bootcamp) and use code from High Card above to construct a working High Card game. Submit a pull request once done.

Don't forget to [run npm install in the starter code directory.](../logistics/required-hardware-and-software.md#eslint-npm-configuration-libraries)

## Comfortable

#### High / Low Card

Players can draw multiple cards each. The winner is the player with the greatest difference in rank between highest and lowest cards in his hand.

Use CSS to display each players' cards in a row.







* Update the game to add a Play Hand button. The user can continue to deal cards to themselves with the Deal button.
* When the user clicks the Play Hand button the computer is dealt the same amount of cards in the user's hand, and the player with the highest card in both hands wins.
* The game ends when the deck is out of cards. When the deck is out of cards, reset the game to the starting values.

## More Comfortable

#### Card Display

Arrange cards so highest and lowest cards in each hand are displayed next to each other in the row.

#### Number of Cards

Create a text input and submit button for players to indicate how many cards should be drawn per player before they play the game. The players can draw in any order until they have each drawn the designated number of cards. Display the winner after the players draw the final card.



Update a scoreboard when the deck runs out of cards. The player who had more winning hands gets 1 point.
