# 1.POCE.5: Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

Create a game of Tic Tac Toe that multiple players can play on a single computer.

## Setup

Fork and clone the [SWE Bootcamp Tic Tac Toe repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/tictactoe-bootcamp). Incorporate the code below to build a working Tic Tac Toe game.

We will design our app such that board elements are immutable, and when users click the board, the app will re-render the board from scratch. We will use an array of arrays to represent our board, where we can think of the "2D" array indexes as grid coordinates.

{% code title="script.js" %}

```javascript
/*
 * Global Variables
 */

// Store TTT board data in an array of arrays (aka 2D array)
const board = [
  ["", "", ""],
  ["", "", ""],
  ["", "", ""],
];

// The HTML element that contains the TTT board
let boardContainer;

// Current player starts at X and alternates to O
let currentPlayer = "X";

/*
 * Helper Functions
 */

// Rebuild the board on click
const buildBoard = (board) => {
  // Start with empty container
  boardContainer.innerHTML = "";

  // Move through the board data array and create current board state
  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i += 1) {
    // New variable per board row array and row HTML element
    const row = board[i];
    const rowElement = document.createElement("div");
    rowElement.classList.add("row");

    // Create the element and set the value of each board square
    // j represents the column number
    for (let j = 0; j < row.length; j += 1) {
      // Create a new HTML element for each board square
      const square = document.createElement("div");
      square.classList.add("square");

      // Set the text of the square according to the board data array
      square.innerText = board[i][j];

      // Append this square to the row
      rowElement.appendChild(square);

      // Set behaviour when user clicks on this square
      square.addEventListener("click", () => {
        handleSquareClick(i, j);
      });
    }

    // Add completed row to board container
    boardContainer.appendChild(rowElement);
  }
};

/*
 * Game initialisation logic
 */

// Create board container element and put it on screen
const initGame = () => {
  boardContainer = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(boardContainer);

  // Build initial board
  buildBoard(board);
};

/*
 * Gameplay logic
 */

// Toggle between players X and O
const togglePlayer = () => {
  if (currentPlayer === "X") {
    currentPlayer = "O";
  } else {
    currentPlayer = "X";
  }
};

// Respond to a user's click on a square
const handleSquareClick = (column, row) => {
  console.log("Clicked coordinates", column, row);

  // Ignore click if this square has been clicked before
  if (board[column][row] !== "") {
    return;
  }

  // Set value of clicked square in board data array to be current player's symbol
  board[column][row] = currentPlayer;

  // Render new board with data from updated board data array
  buildBoard(board);

  // Toggle to the next player
  togglePlayer();
};
```

{% endcode %}

{% code title="styles.css" %}

```css
.square {
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
  background-color: white;
  display: inline-block;
  height: 10px;
  width: 10px;
  vertical-align: top;
}
```

{% endcode %}

## Base

### Check Win

Add a `checkWin` function that runs when a player clicks a square. When a player wins, display the winning player's symbol on screen and reset the game.

```javascript
const checkWin = (board) => {
  // Use conditionals to check all win conditions. Return true if win.

  if (board[0][0] === board[0][1] && board[0][1] === board[0][2]) {
    // XXX
    return true;
  }

  if (board[0][0] === board[1][0] && board[1][0] === board[2][0]) {
    // X
    // X
    // X
    return true;
  }

  // More win conditions...

  // If no win conditions met, return false.
  return false;
};

const handleSquareClick = function (column, row) {
  if (board[column][row] === "") {
    board[column][row] = currentPlayer;

    if (checkWin()) {
      // End and reset game
    } else {
      togglePlayer();
    }
  }
};
```

## Comfortable

Check for wins by advancing through the board with sets of 2 nested loops. You would need to write a set of nested loops for each of the following directions: vertical, horizontal, diagonally top left to bottom right and diagonally bottom left to top right across the board.

The following code example checks for wins in horizontal rows.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i += 1) {
  // Initialise isWin to be true for each row, until the row is proven not have a win condition
  let isWin = true;

  // Initialise startingVal so it can be used throughout the inner for loop
  let startingVal;

  // Loop through a single row
  for (let j = 0; j < board.length; j += 1) {
    // Save the first value in the row in startingVal to compare with other values in the row
    if (j == 0) {
      startingVal = board[i][j];

      // After saving the first row value in startingVal, skip to the next row value
      continue;
    }

    // If any row values are not equal to startingVal, set isWin to false because there is no win condition
    if (board[i][j] !== startingVal) {
      isWin = false;
    }
  }

  // If there was a win condition in the row, return true. Otherwise, inspect
  // each subsequent row until there are no more rows to inspect.
  if (isWin) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

## More Comfortable

### User chooses board size

Allow the user to enter the size of board they want.

### User chooses num squares to win

Allow the user to enter the number of squares in a row that makes a win.

### CPU Easy

Create a computer player that makes a random square choice to play.

### CPU Medium

Create a computer player that will make a random choice, unless the player is about to win, then blocks them.

### CPU Hard

Create a computer player that tries to win the game.
