# 1.POCE.4: Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

Create a game of Tic Tac Toe that multiple players can play on a single computer.

## Setup

Fork and clone the [SWE Bootcamp Tic Tac Toe repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/tictactoe-bootcamp). Incorporate the code below to build a working Tic Tac Toe game.

We will design our app such that board elements are immutable, and when users click the board, the app will re-render the board from scratch. We will use an array of arrays to represent our board, where we can think of the "2D" array indexes as grid coordinates.

{% code title="script.js" %}

```javascript
/*
 * Global Variables
 */

// Store TTT board data in an array of arrays (aka 2D array)
const board = [
  ["", "", ""],
  ["", "", ""],
  ["", "", ""],
];

// The HTML element that contains the TTT board
let boardContainer;

// Current player starts at X and alternates to O
let currentPlayer = "X";

/*
 * Helper Functions
 */

// Rebuild the board on click
const buildBoard = (board) => {
  // Start with empty container
  boardContainer.innerHTML = "";

  // Move through the board data array and create current board state
  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i += 1) {
    // New variable per board row array and row HTML element
    const row = board[i];
    const rowElement = document.createElement("div");
    rowElement.classList.add("row");

    // Create the element and set the value of each board square
    // j represents the column number
    for (let j = 0; j < row.length; j += 1) {
      // Create a new HTML element for each board square
      const square = document.createElement("div");
      square.classList.add("square");

      // Set the text of the square according to the board data array
      square.innerText = board[i][j];

      // Append this square to the row
      rowElement.appendChild(square);

      // Set behaviour when user clicks on this square
      square.addEventListener("click", () => {
        handleSquareClick(i, j);
      });
    }

    // Add completed row to board container
    boardContainer.appendChild(rowElement);
  }
};

/*
 * Game initialisation logic
 */

// Create board container element and put it on screen
const initGame = () => {
  boardContainer = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(boardContainer);

  // Build initial board
  buildBoard(board);
};

/*
 * Gameplay logic
 */

// Toggle between players X and O
const togglePlayer = () => {
  if (currentPlayer === "X") {
    currentPlayer = "O";
  } else {
    currentPlayer = "X";
  }
};

// Respond to a user's click on a square
const handleSquareClick = (column, row) => {
  console.log("Clicked coordinates", column, row);

  // Ignore click if this square has been clicked before
  if (board[column][row] !== "") {
    return;
  }

  // Set value of clicked square in board data array to be current player's symbol
  board[column][row] = currentPlayer;

  // Render new board with data from updated board data array
  buildBoard(board);

  // Toggle to the next player
  togglePlayer();
};
```

{% endcode %}

{% code title="styles.css" %}

```css
.square {
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
  background-color: white;
  display: inline-block;
  height: 10px;
  width: 10px;
  vertical-align: top;
}
```

{% endcode %}

## Base

### Check Win

Add a `checkWin` function that runs when a player clicks a square. When a player wins, display the winning player's symbol on screen and reset the game.

```javascript
const checkWin = (board) => {
  // Use conditionals to check all win conditions. Return true if win.

  if (board[0][0] === board[0][1] && board[0][1] === board[0][2]) {
    // XXX
    return true;
  }

  if (board[0][0] === board[1][0] && board[1][0] === board[2][0]) {
    // X
    // X
    // X
    return true;
  }

  // More win conditions...

  // If no win conditions met, return false.
  return false;
};

const handleSquareClick = function (column, row) {
  if (board[column][row] === "") {
    board[column][row] = currentPlayer;

    if (checkWin()) {
      // End and reset game
    } else {
      togglePlayer();
    }
  }
};
```

## Comfortable

Check for wins by advancing through the board with sets of 2 nested loops. You would need to write a set of nested loops for each of the following directions: vertical, horizontal, diagonally top left to bottom right and diagonally bottom left to top right across the board.

The following code example checks for wins in horizontal rows.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i += 1) {
  // Initialise isWin to be true for each row, until the row is proven not have a win condition
  let isWin = true;

  // Initialise startingVal so it can be used throughout the inner for loop
  let startingVal;

  // Loop through a single row
  for (let j = 0; j < board.length; j += 1) {
    // Save the first value in the row in startingVal to compare with other values in the row
    if (j == 0) {
      startingVal = board[i][j];

      // After saving the first row value in startingVal, skip to the next row value
      continue;
    }

    // If any row values are not equal to startingVal, set isWin to false because there is no win condition
    if (board[i][j] !== startingVal) {
      isWin = false;
    }
  }

  // If there was a win condition in the row, return true. Otherwise, inspect
  // each subsequent row until there are no more rows to inspect.
  if (isWin) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

## More Comfortable

### User chooses board size

Allow the user to enter the size of board they want.

### User chooses num squares to win

Allow the user to enter the number of squares in a row that makes a win.

### CPU Easy

Create a computer player that makes a random square choice to play.

### CPU Medium

Create a computer player that will make a random choice, unless the player is about to win, then blocks them.

### CPU Hard

Create a computer player that tries to win the game.

# 7.POCE.2: React Tic Tac Toe

## Setup

Begin with the [base React repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp).

## Base

Create a playable game of tic tac toe in React. Switch between players automatically. The game ends when all squares are filled.

The board should be represented in a state variable using `useState`.

Don't use components for this game. Code everything in the `App` component.

### Creating the Board

When creating the click events for the board, use `map` with `index` and inline anonymous functions so that a callback function is able to access the position of a specific element on the board \(e.g, board\[0\]\[2\]\).

#### map with index

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 6, 8, 9];
const doubled = numbers.map((num, index) => {
  console.log(num, index);
  return num * 2;
});
```

#### `map` with inline callback

Note that on line 18 we specify a click event callback. When creating the tic tac toe game grid, use similar syntax so that we are able to access the the position of the square that was clicked. In the context of a tic tac toe board data structure, `index` would represent a row or column.

```jsx
// a function that takes index as a parameter
const saySomething = (num, index) => {
  console.log(`${num}: ${index}`);

// array to use with map
const numbers = [4, 6, 8, 9];

// create a button for each number
const buttons = numbers.map((num, index) => {
  console.log(num, index);

  // when the button gets clicked, define an
  // anon func. In the anon func, call saySomething
  // index is passed into saySomething and we are able to access index in this way (lines 1-2)
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        saySomething(num, index);
      }}
    >
      {num}
    </button>
  );
});
```

#### Board Data Structure

We'll use a nested array, like the one shown below, to represent the board. Replace each blank space \( ' ' \) with an 'X' or an 'O' by updating state, and thereby updating the DOM, as the game progresses.

```jsx
[
  ["", "", ""],
  ["", "", ""],
  ["", "", ""],
];
```

#### Nested Maps

In order to iterate over this data structure a nested map will be needed to build the elements. Run the example code given below to see how this works. Note that CSS needs to be added to give it the appearance of a tic-tac-toe board.

```jsx
// array to use with map
const numbers = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];

// this line maps the 3 arrays that are in numbers, each row is one of those arrays
// rowIndex is the index number of each row (e.g, numbers[0])
// we use rowIndex here to keep track of / be able to access the row that we want
const rows = numbers.map((row, rowIndex) => {
  // this line takes each individual row (array) and maps the elements that are inside that array
  // here, similar to the code above, colIndex is the index of each element inside 1 row
  const buttons = row.map((num, colIndex) => <button>{num}</button>);

  return <div>{buttons}</div>;
});

// rows is an array of div *elements* that have 3 buttons inside.
console.log(rows);
```

## Comfortable

#### Reset

Create a button to reset the game.

#### Game Over

See if the game is won when a click happens.

#### Dynamic Board Size

Create a dropdown that allows the user to select the size of the board.

## More Comfortable

Create a computer player.
