There are really **no hard or fast rules** when it comes to web design but you can use the following guidelines as recommendation
{% endhint %}

## Typography

- Use `font-size` between `15px` and `25px`
- Use big font sizes for headlines
- Use line spacing between `120%` and `150%` of the `font-size`
- 45 to 90 characters per line
- Use font families such as such as _Sans-serif_ or _Serif_
  - _Sans-serif_
    - Open Sans
    - Lato
    - Raleway
    - Monsterrat
    - PT Sans
  - _Serif_
    - Cardo
    - Merriweather
    - PT Serif
- Use minimal typeface. A good rule of thumb is nothing more than 2

## Colors

- Use only one base color (other than black, white or grey)

- Use a tool if you want to use more colors
  - One example is using a color wheel with color theory
- Use highly attractive colors to draw attention such to key features such as a "Sign up" button
- Try not to use too much black in your colors
- Choose your colors wisely as they evoke different emotions

## Images

{% hint style="info" %}
The options below should complement the look and feel of your website so play around with all the options before deciding on one
{% endhint %}

- Put text directly on the image
  - Choose highly contrasting colors for the text
- Overlay the image with color gradients
  - Avoid the use of black or white gradients
- Put text in a box above your image
- Blur your image
- Floor fade your image (image should "fade" away at the bottom)

## Icons

- Use icons to list features or steps of your website
  - Helps a user to quickly browse your website and get an idea of what your website is all about
- Use icons for actions and links
  1. Icons should be instantly recognizable
  2. Label your icons with text (if possible)
- Icons should play a supporting role and not take center stage of your design
- Use icon fonts whenever possible&#x20;
  - Prefer vector icons (e.g `.svg`) over raster images (e.g. `.jpeg`, `.gif`)
