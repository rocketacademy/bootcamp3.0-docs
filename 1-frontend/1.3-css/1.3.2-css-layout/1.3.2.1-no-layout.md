    <h1>All About Noodles</h1>

    <p>
      Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat
      and cut, stretched or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can
      be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or
      salt added. They are also often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can
      include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material composition
      and geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of
      noodles. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures (see Chinese noodles,
      Japanese noodles, Korean noodles, Filipino noodles, Vietnamese noodles,
      and Italian pasta).

    <h2>Origin</h2>

    <p>
      The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the
      Eastern Han period (25â€“220 CE). It became a staple food for the people of
      the Han dynasty. Food historians generally estimate that pasta's origin is
      from among the Mediterranean countries: homogenous mixture of flour and
      water called itrion as described by 2nd century Greek physician Galen,
      among 3rd to 5th centuries Palestinians itrium as described by the
      Jerusalem Talmud and itriyya (Arabic cognate of the Greek word),
      string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking as defined by
      the 9th century Aramean physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali.
