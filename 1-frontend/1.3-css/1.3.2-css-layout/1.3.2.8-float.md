# 1.2.2.8: Float

Another type of style similar to position is float. If we want another degree of position control of an element we can use float. Mostly this would be used when we want text to surround this element.

<h1>All About Noodles</h1>
<p>
  Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and
  cut, stretched or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can be
  refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.
</p>
<p>
  Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or
  salt added. They are also often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can
  include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material composition and
  geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of noodles.
  Noodles are a staple food in many cultures (see Chinese noodles, Japanese
  noodles, Korean noodles, Filipino noodles, Vietnamese noodles, and Italian
  pasta).
</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>
  The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the Eastern
  Han period (25â€“220 CE). It became a staple food for the people of the Han
  dynasty. Food historians generally estimate that pasta's origin is from among
  the Mediterranean countries: homogenous mixture of flour and water called
  itrion as described by 2nd century Greek physician Galen, among 3rd to 5th
  centuries Palestinians itrium as described by the Jerusalem Talmud and itriyya
  (Arabic cognate of the Greek word), string-like shapes made of semolina and
  dried before cooking as defined by the 9th century Aramean physician and
  lexicographer Isho bar Ali.
