# 1.2.1: Basic Layout

## Learning Objectives

1. CSS layout is about organising HTML elements into nested boxes and determining their positions

## Introduction

When determining how to layout elements with CSS, first organise elements into nested boxes, then determine which CSS styles need to apply to which boxes. By default browsers will render all HTML elements in a single vertical column.

## CSS Box Model

![Margin is spacing outside the content's border. Padding is spacing inside the content's border. Source: W3Schools](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1.3 - CSS Layout - 3 - Box Model.png>)

​

The CSS box model controls how much space an element takes on screen with CSS properties such as content `width`, content `height`, `margin` (area outside border), `border` (area surrounding content) and `padding` (area inside border but outside content). While helpful for controlling exact size of HTML elements, we recommend using flexbox properties (covered in later submodule) to layout HTML elements for a more robust layout.

### 3 common ways to specify box dimensions

#### 1) Pixel count

Only works for block display elements. Generally less recommended because difficult to create responsive (mobile and desktop-friendly) layouts with fixed pixel sizes.

```css
p {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

#### 2) Percent of parent container

Percentage is relative to the parent container, allows responsive sizing. Percentage height does not work unless parent has fixed size.

```css
p {
  width: 50%;
  height: 100px;
}
```

#### 3) Percent of viewport (window)

Viewport sizing allows for most responsive sizing based on screen size, but needs to be coordinated with other elements on screen since sizing is not relative to other elements.

```css
p {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Debugging CSS boxes

Chrome helps us visualise CSS box properties of every element on every page at the bottom of the Styles window in the Elements tab in Chrome DevTools. To see box properties of any HTML element, right click the element and click "Inspect". Box properties in the box visualisation should match the most-specific box properties at the top of the CSS styles list (ordered in decreasing specificity).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Apply `box-sizing` CSS property to include padding and border in box size**

CSS does not include padding and border in box size by default. In the following example, CSS produces a box 300px wide (including 50px of padding on both sides), even though we specify width of 200px.

```css
p {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 50px;
}
```

To make `width` and `height` include padding and border space, apply the `box-sizing` CSS property to all elements.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## CSS `display` Property

The CSS `display` property controls the way target elements render on screen. The 2 most basic `display` values are `block` (full screen width) and `inline` (width of element only). By default, every HTML element has either block or inline layout.

`inline-block` is a 3rd `display` property that enables `inline` elements with `block` properties such as spacing on all sides. `inline` elements cannot have custom spacing around them.

## Centring Elements on Screen

The `margin` property's `auto` value allows us to automatically set left and right margins to centre an element on screen. Only `block` elements can be centred.&#x20;

```css
.main {
  margin: 0 auto; /* 0 top and bottom margin, auto left and right margin */
}
```

### Constraining element width

In addition to centring elements, we may also want to constraint element width to prevent content from becoming hard to read across the full width of a horizontal screen. We will look at fixed, percent and max width layout to do this.

#### Fixed-Width Layout

Fixed-width layout fixes the width of the target element, regardless of how small or large the screen size is. This works for large screen sizes but may look poor on small screen sizes.

```css
.main {
  width: 600px; /* 600px is reasonable default width of centre column */
  margin: 0 auto; /* 0 top and bottom margin, auto left and right margin */
}
```

#### Percent-Width Layout

Percent-width layout fixes width to be a percentage of screen width. This makes our content responsive but may not be what we want, especially if we want layout to be different across mobile and desktop.

```css
.main {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto; /* 0 top and bottom margin, auto left and right margin */
}
```

#### Max-Width Layout

Max-width layout allows our element to occupy 100% of screen width at smaller screen sizes but only a specified width at larger screen sizes. This helps when we wish to maximise screen real estate on mobile devices but not make content too wide on desktop devices.

```css
.main {
  max-width: 600px; /* be 100% width, until 600px */
  margin: 0 auto; /* 0 top and bottom margin, auto left and right margin */
}
```

# 1.2.2.6: Layout: Columns and Cards

## Cards

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cards-layout.png)

Card design is when a set of boxes is displayed next to each other in a layout. One of the simplest ways to create this layout is to specify some fixed pixel width elements on the screen and give them `display` `inline-block.`

## Columns

Now we'll use `inline-block` to create column layouts.

      Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat
      and cut, stretched or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can
      be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.
      Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or
      salt added. They are also often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can
      include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material composition
      and geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of
      noodles. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures (see Chinese noodles,
      Japanese noodles, Korean noodles, Filipino noodles, Vietnamese noodles,
      and Italian pasta).
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the

    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
/* correct for sizing */
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  background-color: pink;
  margin: 0; /* also to correct for sizing */
}

.column {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 48%;
  background-color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 20px;
  vertical-align: top; /* otherwise a shorter box will be stuck to the baseline of the taller box */
}
```

## Limitations

Note that for all of these layouts, the alignment and size of the boxes is not perfect. For example, the column layout doesn't have equal-height boxes. The columns are not set to a perfect amount of percent (i.e., 50%) The card layout may be awkward looking at certain screen widths. For right now don't worry too much about all the boxes aligning perfectly. Some of these behaviours we will get for free in the Bootstrap CSS library and with Flexbox layout.

# 1.2.2.7: Position

When describing the functionality of elements with display we are discussing what happens when we fill elements with a certain amount of contents (text, images, other boxes, etc.), and then we let CSS lay out those boxes according to predetermined rules. The browser layout engine adjusts the size, shape and location of a set of elements and boxes based on:

1. The CSS box model
2. The display property
3. The contents of the box

There are a lot of overlapping rules to the behaviour of boxes using these attributes. Thus, there are some more **rare** cases when, instead of allowing CSS to lay out those boxes according to size and rules, we want to have a higher degree of control over where those boxes get placed.

This level of control is the `position` style. This style overrides any natural display layout behaviour in favor of more specific instructions of where to put a box.

### Setting Position

The position settings `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` set the _**offset from**_ the element's default position. Any unit can be used to set the position of the element: pixels, percent, em, vw, etc.

```css
p {
  position: fixed;
  top: 300px;
}
```

### Position Relative

```css
p {
  position: relative;
  top: 6px;
  left: 6px;
}
```

_(Relative position is rarely used on its own.)_

Relative position means that the element takes up space but can be moved from where it was supposed to be.

### Position Absolute

```css
p {
  position: absolute;
  top: 6px;
  left: 6px;
}
```

_(Absolute position is rarely used on its own.)_

Absolute position means that the element is taken completely out of the normal box-model document flow.

### Position Relative / Absolute

```css
.card {
  position: relative;
}
.icon {
  position: absolute;
  top: 6px;
  left: 6px;
}
```

When an element is set to absolute that limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements- That is, the child component's position will be absolute to the parent, not the entire screen.

Use cases:

- images that overlap contents in front or behind
- game-like elements that are inside something with pixel-fixed dimensions
- icons inside an element
- notification count numbers

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-07-21-at-8.09.13-pm-1.png)

### Position Fixed

```css
p {
  position: fixed;
}
```

Use cases:

- navigation bars
- chat windows

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-07-21-at-8.05.02-pm.png)

### z-index

When there is more than one element that has the position attribute it's possible that they will stack on top of eachother. The last element mentioned in the HTML will be on top. The style that controls the stacking order of the elements is z-index.

```html
<p id="announce">Ipsum</p>
<p>Lorem</p>
```

```css
p {
  position: absolute;
  top: 6px;
  left: 6px;
}
#announce {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

# 1.2.2.8: Float

Another type of style similar to position is float. If we want another degree of position control of an element we can use float. Mostly this would be used when we want text to surround this element.
