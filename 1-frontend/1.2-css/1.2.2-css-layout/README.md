When determining how to layout elements with CSS, first organise elements into nested boxes, then determine which CSS styles need to apply to which boxes. By default browsers will render all HTML elements in a single vertical column.

## `display` CSS Property

The `display` CSS property determines whether HTML elements follow inline (width of element only) or block (full screen width) layout. By default, every HTML element follows either inline or block layout. We cannot customise vertical spacing above and below inline elements.
